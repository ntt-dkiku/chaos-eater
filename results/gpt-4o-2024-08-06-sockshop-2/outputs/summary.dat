The Chaos Engineering cycle for the Sock Shop application involved a detailed process to test the system's resilience under simulated fault conditions. The system is composed of various Kubernetes manifests that define different components of the Sock Shop application, such as deployments and services for carts, catalogue, orders, payment, and user management, among others. The application is a microservices-based e-commerce platform designed to demonstrate Kubernetes orchestration.

The cycle began with an understanding of the user inputs, which included a detailed analysis of the Kubernetes manifests. Each manifest was summarized to highlight its purpose, such as defining a namespace, deployment, or service, and specifying configurations like replicas, resource limits, and security contexts.

The system's resiliency issues were identified, including missing port configurations in service manifests, single replica deployments, and high initial delays for liveness and readiness probes. These issues were considered potential weaknesses that could affect the system's ability to maintain steady states during fault scenarios.

The Chaos Engineering experiment was designed to test the hypothesis that the system's steady states would be maintained even when faults were injected. Two steady states were defined: 'CartsServiceEndpointsAvailable' and 'FrontEndLivenessProbeSuccess'. The experiment was structured into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation, each with specific tasks and time allocations.

During the pre-validation phase, the system's initial steady state was verified by running unit tests to check the availability of the 'carts' service endpoints and the responsiveness of the 'front-end' pod. The fault-injection phase involved simulating a Black Friday sale scenario with 'StressChaos', 'NetworkChaos', and 'PodChaos' faults to test the system's resilience under high load and network issues. The post-validation phase re-verified the steady states to ensure the system recovered after the faults.

The first experiment attempt revealed failures in the 'FrontEndLivenessProbeSuccess' test during the fault-injection and post-validation phases, indicating issues with the single replica configuration and resource constraints. Based on the analysis, improvements were made by increasing the number of replicas for the 'front-end' deployment and adjusting the liveness probe configuration.

The second experiment attempt, with the improved configuration, successfully passed all unit tests, confirming that the system maintained its steady states under the simulated fault conditions. This cycle demonstrated the importance of redundancy, resource optimization, and probe configuration in enhancing system resilience.
