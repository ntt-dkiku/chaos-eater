It offers users the ability to browse a catalogue of socks, add items to a cart, place orders, and manage user accounts. The application is composed of multiple microservices, each responsible for a specific function within the e-commerce workflow, such as handling orders, managing user sessions, and processing payments.; The manifests provided are part of a well-known microservices demo application called 'Sock Shop'. This application is designed to demonstrate the use of microservices architecture and Kubernetes orchestration. The file names, labels, and images used in the manifests (e.g., 'weaveworksdemos') are indicative of the Sock Shop application, which simulates an e-commerce website for selling socks. The application includes various services such as carts, catalogue, orders, payment, and user management, each with its own database and service components, reflecting a typical e-commerce platform's architecture.\n\nChaos-Engineering instructions for the system are as follows: - The Chaos-Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute.\n\n- When using k6 in steady-state definition, always select a request URL from the following options (other requests are invalid):\n  1. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/\n  2. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/catalogue?size=10\n  3. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/detail.html?id=<ID>\n  Replace <ID> with an available ID: [`03fef6ac-1896-4ce8-bd69-b798f85c6e0b`, `3395a43e-2d88-40de-b95f-e00e1502085b`, `510a0d7e-8e83-4193-b483-e27e09ddc34d`, `808a2de1-1aaa-4c25-a9b9-6612e8f29a38`, `819e1fbf-8b7e-4f6d-811f-693534916a8b`, `837ab141-399e-4c1f-9abc-bace40296bac`, `a0a4f044-b040-410d-8ead-4de0446aec7e`, `d3588630-ad8e-49df-bbd7-3167f7efb246`, `zzz4f044-b040-410d-8ead-4de0446aec7e`]\n  4. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/category/\n  5. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/category?tags=<TAG>\n  Replace <TAG> with an available tag: [`magic`, `action`, `blue`, `brown`, `black`, `sport`, `formal`, `red`, `green`, `skin`, `geek`]\n  6. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/basket.html\n\n## Step 1. Hypothesis definition\n### Here is the overview of the hypothesis for the system:\nThe hypothesis is \"The steady states of the sytem are maintained even when the fault scenario occurs (i.e., when the faults are injected)\".\nThe steady states here are as follows:\n2 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: CartsServiceEndpointsAvailable\n- Description: The first issue to address is the 'Missing Port Configuration' in the Service manifests. This issue is likely to cause connectivity problems, making it a critical aspect to verify. Among the manifests with this issue, 'sock-shop-2/manifests/02-carts-svc.yaml' is selected as it is the first in the list. The steady state will ensure that the Service is functioning correctly by checking the number of endpoints available for the 'carts' service, which should match the number of replicas in the corresponding Deployment.\n- Threshold for the steady state: At least 1 endpoint must be available for the 'carts' service 95% of the time during a 1-minute period, with a target of 2 endpoints available.; The steady state to be verified is the availability of endpoints for the 'carts' service, which should match the number of replicas specified in the corresponding Deployment. The Deployment for 'carts' specifies 2 replicas, and the current state shows that there are 2 endpoints available consistently over a period of 5 seconds. This indicates that the system is currently in a healthy state. To account for potential fluctuations and ensure the system remains resilient, a reasonable threshold should allow for a small tolerance. Given the redundancy with 2 replicas, the threshold can be set to require at least 1 endpoint to be available at all times, but ideally, both should be available. Additionally, the threshold should specify that this condition must be met for at least 95% of the time during the 1-minute chaos experiment, allowing for brief disruptions without failing the steady state check.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestCartsServiceEndpoints(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.apps_v1 = client.AppsV1Api()  # Initialize AppsV1Api\n        self.namespace = 'sock-shop'\n        self.service_name = 'carts'\n        self.deployment_name = 'carts'\n\n    def get_endpoints_count(self):\n        endpoints = self.v1.read_namespaced_endpoints(self.service_name, self.namespace)\n        return len(endpoints.subsets[0].addresses) if endpoints.subsets else 0\n\n    def get_replicas_count(self):\n        deployment = self.apps_v1.read_namespaced_deployment(self.deployment_name, self.namespace)  # Use AppsV1Api\n        return deployment.status.replicas\n\n    def test_endpoints_availability(self, duration):\n        success_count = 0\n        total_checks = duration\n\n        for _ in range(duration):\n            endpoints_count = self.get_endpoints_count()\n            replicas_count = self.get_replicas_count()\n            print(f'Endpoints available: {endpoints_count}, Expected replicas: {replicas_count}')\n\n            # Check if at least 1 endpoint is available\n            if endpoints_count >= 1:\n                success_count += 1\n\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the success rate\n        success_rate = (success_count / total_checks) * 100\n        print(f'Success rate: {success_rate}%')\n\n        # Assert that the success rate is at least 95%\n        assert success_rate >= 95, f'Success rate {success_rate}% is below the threshold of 95%'\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test Carts Service Endpoints Availability')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=60, help='Duration to check the state in seconds')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    test = TestCartsServiceEndpoints()\n    test.test_endpoints_availability(args.duration)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\n```2nd steady states:\n- Name: FrontEndLivenessProbeSuccess\n- Description: The next issue to address is the 'Single Replica Deployment' in the 'sock-shop-2/manifests/09-front-end-dep.yaml'. This issue is critical because having only one replica can lead to downtime if the pod fails. To ensure the system's resilience, we need to verify that the single replica of the 'front-end' deployment is always available. The steady state will check the availability of the 'front-end' pod by ensuring that the liveness probe is successful 95% of the time during a 1-minute period. This will help us confirm that the single replica is stable and responsive, even though it lacks redundancy.\n- Threshold for the steady state: The liveness probe for the 'front-end' pod must be successful at least 95% of the time during a 1-minute monitoring period.; The steady state to be verified is the availability of the 'front-end' pod, specifically ensuring that the liveness probe is successful 95% of the time during a 1-minute period. The current state shows a 100% success rate, which is above the required 95%. To account for fluctuations and ensure the system remains stable, we can set a threshold that allows for some tolerance. Given that the current success rate is 100%, setting the threshold at 95% is reasonable and ensures that the system is considered stable even if there are minor fluctuations. This threshold is also aligned with the requirement to complete the Chaos-Engineering experiment within 1 minute, as it allows for quick verification of the system's stability.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestFrontEndLivenessProbe(K8sAPIBase):\n    def check_frontend_liveness(self, namespace, duration):\n        success_count = 0\n        total_checks = 0\n\n        for _ in range(duration):\n            # List pods with the label 'name=front-end' in the specified namespace\n            pods = self.v1.list_namespaced_pod(namespace=namespace, label_selector=\"name=front-end\").items\n            if pods:\n                pod = pods[0]\n                if pod.status.conditions:\n                    for condition in pod.status.conditions:\n                        if condition.type == \"Ready\" and condition.status == \"True\":\n                            success_count += 1\n                            break\n            total_checks += 1\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the success rate of the liveness probe\n        success_rate = (success_count / total_checks) * 100\n        print(f\"Liveness Probe Success Rate: {success_rate}%\")\n        return success_rate\n\n    def test_liveness_probe_success_rate(self, namespace='sock-shop', duration=60):\n        # Check the liveness probe success rate\n        success_rate = self.check_frontend_liveness(namespace, duration)\n        # Assert that the success rate is at least 95%\n        assert success_rate >= 95, f\"Liveness probe success rate is below 95%: {success_rate}%\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test Front-End Liveness Probe Success Rate')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=60, help='Duration to check the liveness probe in seconds')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    # Create an instance of the test class\n    test_instance = TestFrontEndLivenessProbe()\n    # Run the test with the specified duration\n    test_instance.test_liveness_probe_success_rate(duration=args.duration)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\nThe fault scenario here is as follows:\n\nAn assumed fault scenario is as follows:\n- Event: Black Friday Sale\n- Used Chaos Engineering tool: Chaos Mesh\n- Faults to simulate the event: [[Fault(name='StressChaos', name_id=0, params={'mode': 'all', 'value': '2', 'stressors': {'cpu': {'workers': 2, 'load': 100}}, 'containerNames': ['carts'], 'selector': {'namespaces': ['sock-shop'], 'labelSelectors': {'name': 'carts'}}}), Fault(name='StressChaos', name_id=1, params={'mode': 'all', 'stressors': {'cpu': {'workers': 2, 'load': 80}}, 'containerNames': ['front-end'], 'selector': {'namespaces': ['sock-shop'], 'labelSelectors': {'name': 'front-end'}}})], [Fault(name='NetworkChaos', name_id=0, params={'action': 'delay', 'mode': 'all', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['sock-shop'], 'labelSelectors': {'name': 'front-end'}}, 'direction': 'to', 'device': 'eth0', 'delay': {'latency': '100ms', 'jitter': '10ms', 'correlation': '50'}})], [Fault(name='PodChaos', name_id=0, params={'action': 'pod-kill', 'mode': 'one', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['sock-shop'], 'labelSelectors': {'name': 'front-end'}}, 'value': '1'})]]\n- Description: During a Black Friday sale, the system is expected to handle a significant increase in traffic and load. This event will test the system's ability to maintain steady states under high demand. The 'CartsServiceEndpointsAvailable' steady state is crucial as it ensures the availability of the carts service, which is essential for users to add items to their cart. The 'FrontEndLivenessProbeSuccess' steady state is also critical as it ensures the front-end is responsive, allowing users to browse and make purchases. The system's weaknesses include missing port configurations, a single replica deployment for the front-end, and high initial delays for probes. To simulate the Black Friday event, we will first inject a 'StressChaos' fault to simulate high CPU usage on the 'carts' and 'front-end' pods, testing their ability to handle increased load. Next, we will inject a 'NetworkChaos' fault to simulate network latency, testing the system's resilience to network issues during high traffic. Finally, we will inject a 'PodChaos' fault to kill the single replica of the 'front-end' pod, testing the system's ability to recover from pod failures without redundancy.\n\n## Step 2.1. Chaos-Engineering experiment\n### Here is the overview of my Chaos-Engineering experiment to verify the hypothesis:\nThe entire time schedule of the Chaos-Engineering experiment is as follows (The experiment is divided into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation phases):\nTo design a Chaos Engineering experiment for the Sock Shop application, we need to ensure that the system can maintain its steady states during fault injection. The experiment will be divided into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation. The total duration of the experiment is constrained to 1 minute, so we need to allocate time efficiently across these phases. \n\n1. **Pre-validation Phase:** This phase ensures that the system is in a steady state before injecting any faults. Given the constraints, we will allocate 15 seconds for this phase. During this time, we will verify the two steady states: 'CartsServiceEndpointsAvailable' and 'FrontEndLivenessProbeSuccess'. This involves checking the availability of endpoints for the 'carts' service and the success rate of the liveness probe for the 'front-end' pod.\n\n2. **Fault-injection Phase:** This phase involves injecting faults to simulate the Black Friday sale scenario. We will allocate 30 seconds for this phase. The faults to be injected include:\n   - 'StressChaos' to simulate high CPU usage on the 'carts' and 'front-end' pods.\n   - 'NetworkChaos' to simulate network latency on the 'front-end' pod.\n   - 'PodChaos' to kill the single replica of the 'front-end' pod.\n   These faults will test the system's ability to handle increased load, network issues, and pod failures.\n\n3. **Post-validation Phase:** This phase ensures that the system returns to its steady states after fault injection. We will allocate 15 seconds for this phase. We will re-check the two steady states to confirm that the system has recovered and is functioning as expected.\n\nThe total time for the experiment is 1 minute, with 15 seconds for pre-validation, 30 seconds for fault injection, and 15 seconds for post-validation. This allocation allows us to efficiently test the system's resilience while adhering to the time constraint.\n- Total experiment phase: 1m\n- Pre-validation phase: 15s\n- Fault-injection phase: 30s\n- Post-validation phase: 15s\n\nThe details of the three phases are as follows:\nPre-validation Phase (15s):\nIn the pre-validation phase, we need to ensure that the system is in a steady state before we proceed with fault injection. Given the constraints, we have 15 seconds to perform this validation. We will execute two unit tests to verify the steady states: 'CartsServiceEndpointsAvailable' and 'FrontEndLivenessProbeSuccess'. These tests will be executed simultaneously to maximize the use of the available time. The 'CartsServiceEndpointsAvailable' test will check if the 'carts' service has at least one endpoint available, which is crucial for the system's functionality. The 'FrontEndLivenessProbeSuccess' test will verify that the 'front-end' pod is responsive, ensuring that the user interface is operational. Both tests will run for the entire 15 seconds, with no grace period, to ensure that the system is stable before proceeding to the fault injection phase. This approach allows us to quickly confirm the system's readiness for the chaos experiment.\n\nFault-injection Phase (30s):\nThe fault-injection phase is designed to simulate a Black Friday sale scenario, where the system experiences high load and network issues. The goal is to observe how the system handles these conditions and whether it can maintain its steady states. Given the 30-second time constraint, the faults will be injected in a staggered manner to maximize the observation of their effects. The first set of faults will be StressChaos, targeting the 'carts' and 'front-end' pods to simulate high CPU usage. This will start immediately at the beginning of the phase and last for 10 seconds. The second fault, NetworkChaos, will introduce network latency to the 'front-end' pod, starting at the 10-second mark and lasting for 10 seconds. Finally, PodChaos will be injected at the 20-second mark, targeting the 'front-end' pod to simulate a pod failure, lasting for 10 seconds. This staggered approach allows us to observe the system's behavior under each fault condition separately and in combination, providing insights into its resilience and recovery capabilities.\n\nPost-validation Phase (15s):\nIn the post-validation phase, we need to ensure that the system has returned to its steady states after the fault injection. Given the constraints of a 15-second total time for this phase, we will focus on quickly verifying the two defined steady states: 'CartsServiceEndpointsAvailable' and 'FrontEndLivenessProbeSuccess'. The approach is to execute both unit tests simultaneously to maximize the use of the limited time available. This simultaneous execution is feasible because the tests are independent and can run in parallel without interference. The 'CartsServiceEndpointsAvailable' test will verify that the 'carts' service has the expected number of endpoints available, while the 'FrontEndLivenessProbeSuccess' test will check that the liveness probe for the 'front-end' pod is successful. Both tests will have a grace period of 0s, starting immediately, and will run for the full 15s duration to ensure a thorough check within the time limit. This approach ensures that we can quickly confirm the system's return to its steady states after the chaos experiment.\n\nThe summary of the above experiment plan:\nThe Chaos Engineering experiment for the Sock Shop application is structured into three distinct phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation, all within a total duration of one minute. \n\nIn the pre-validation phase, which lasts for 15 seconds, two unit tests are executed simultaneously to ensure the system is in a steady state before any faults are introduced. The 'CartsServiceEndpointsAvailable' test, with the workflow name 'pre-unittest-cartsserviceendpointsavailable', and the 'FrontEndLivenessProbeSuccess' test, with the workflow name 'pre-unittest-frontendlivenessprobesuccess', both start immediately with no delay and run for the entire 15 seconds. These tests check the availability of the 'carts' service endpoints and the responsiveness of the 'front-end' pod, respectively.\n\nThe fault-injection phase spans 30 seconds and involves a staggered introduction of faults to simulate a high-load scenario akin to a Black Friday sale. Initially, two 'StressChaos' faults are injected simultaneously at the start of the phase, targeting the 'carts' and 'front-end' pods to simulate high CPU usage. These have workflow names 'fault-stresschaos' and 'fault-stresschaos2', each lasting for 10 seconds. At the 10-second mark, 'NetworkChaos' is introduced to the 'front-end' pod to simulate network latency, with the workflow name 'fault-networkchaos', also lasting for 10 seconds. Finally, at the 20-second mark, 'PodChaos' is injected to simulate a pod failure on the 'front-end' pod, with the workflow name 'fault-podchaos', lasting for the remaining 10 seconds. Throughout this phase, the steady states 'CartsServiceEndpointsAvailable' and 'FrontEndLivenessProbeSuccess' are continuously verified with workflows 'fault-unittest-cartsserviceendpointsavailable' and 'fault-unittest-frontendlivenessprobesuccess', each running for the full 30 seconds.\n\nIn the post-validation phase, lasting 15 seconds, the system's return to steady states is verified. The same two unit tests from the pre-validation phase are executed simultaneously again. The 'CartsServiceEndpointsAvailable' test, with the workflow name 'post-unittest-cartsserviceendpointsavailable', and the 'FrontEndLivenessProbeSuccess' test, with the workflow name 'post-unittest-frontendlivenessprobesuccess', both start immediately with no delay and run for the entire 15 seconds. This ensures the system has recovered and is functioning as expected after the fault injections.\n\nTo automatically conduct the above experiment plan with Chaos Mesh, the following Chaos-Mesh-Worfklow file was created (by applying it to the cluster, the experiment plan will be automatically executed according to the Chaos-Mesh-Worfklow file):\n```yaml\napiVersion: chaos-mesh.org/v1alpha1\nkind: Workflow\nmetadata:\n  name: chaos-experiment-20241127-033819\nspec:\n  entry: the-entry\n  templates:\n    #-------------------------------\n    # entry point of whole workflow\n    #-------------------------------\n    -

This analysis will focus on understanding why the 'FrontEndLivenessProbeSuccess' test failed and provide insights for improvement.\n\n1. **Pre-Validation Phase Success**: Both the 'CartsServiceEndpointsAvailable' and 'FrontEndLivenessProbeSuccess' tests passed during the pre-validation phase, indicating that the system was in a steady state before the fault injection. This confirms that the initial configuration of the system was functioning as expected.\n\n2. **Fault-Phase Failure of Front-End Liveness Probe**: During the fault-injection phase, the 'FrontEndLivenessProbeSuccess' test failed with a liveness probe success rate of 60%. This failure can be attributed to the combination of 'StressChaos' and 'NetworkChaos' faults applied to the 'front-end' pod. The 'StressChaos' fault increased CPU load to 80%, which likely caused resource contention and degraded performance. Additionally, the 'NetworkChaos' fault introduced network latency, further impacting the responsiveness of the 'front-end' pod. The combination of high CPU load and network latency likely led to the liveness probe failures, as the pod could not respond in a timely manner.\n\n3. **Post-Validation Phase Failure**: The 'FrontEndLivenessProbeSuccess' test continued to fail in the post-validation phase, with a success rate dropping to 13.33%. This suggests that the system did not recover quickly after the 'PodChaos' fault, which killed the single replica of the 'front-end' pod. The lack of redundancy (only one replica) meant that there was no backup pod to take over, leading to prolonged downtime until the pod was recreated and became ready.\n\n4. **Insights and Recommendations**:\n   - **Increase Replicas for Front-End**: The single replica configuration for the 'front-end' deployment is a critical weakness. Increasing the number of replicas would provide redundancy, allowing the system to maintain availability even if one pod fails. This change would mitigate the impact of the 'PodChaos' fault and improve resilience.\n   - **Optimize Resource Requests and Limits**: The 'front-end' pod's resource requests and limits should be reviewed and potentially increased to handle high CPU loads more effectively. This could involve increasing the CPU and memory requests to ensure the pod has sufficient resources during peak loads.\n   - **Adjust Liveness Probe Configuration**: The liveness probe's initial delay and period settings should be optimized to detect failures more quickly and allow for faster recovery. Reducing the initial delay and period could help identify issues sooner and trigger restarts if necessary.\n   - **Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaling**: Consider implementing horizontal pod autoscaling for the 'front-end' deployment to automatically adjust the number of replicas based on CPU utilization or other metrics. This would allow the system to dynamically scale in response to increased load, improving resilience during high-demand scenarios like a Black Friday sale.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the system can be better prepared to handle similar fault scenarios in the future, maintaining steady states and improving overall resilience.\n\n### Improvement result (1st try)\n1 K8s manifests are modified:\n- The K8s manifest 'sock-shop-2/manifests/09-front-end-dep.yaml' was replaced.\nIncrease the number of replicas from 1 to 3 to provide redundancy and improve availability.

            "{\"summary\":\"The Chaos Engineering cycle for the Sock Shop application involved a detailed process to test the system's resilience under simulated fault conditions. The system is composed of various Kubernetes manifests that define different components of the Sock Shop application, such as deployments and services for carts, catalogue, orders, payment, and user management, among others. The application is a microservices-based e-commerce platform designed to demonstrate Kubernetes orchestration.\\n\\nThe cycle began with an understanding of the user inputs, which included a detailed analysis of the Kubernetes manifests. Each manifest was summarized to highlight its purpose, such as defining a namespace, deployment, or service, and specifying configurations like replicas, resource limits, and security contexts.\\n\\nThe system's resiliency issues were identified, including missing port configurations in service manifests, single replica deployments, and high initial delays for liveness and readiness probes. These issues were considered potential weaknesses that could affect the system's ability to maintain steady states during fault scenarios.\\n\\nThe Chaos Engineering experiment was designed to test the hypothesis that the system's steady states would be maintained even when faults were injected. Two steady states were defined: 'CartsServiceEndpointsAvailable' and 'FrontEndLivenessProbeSuccess'. The experiment was structured into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation, each with specific tasks and time allocations.\\n\\nDuring the pre-validation phase, the system's initial steady state was verified by running unit tests to check the availability of the 'carts' service endpoints and the responsiveness of the 'front-end' pod. The fault-injection phase involved simulating a Black Friday sale scenario with 'StressChaos', 'NetworkChaos', and 'PodChaos' faults to test the system's resilience under high load and network issues. The post-validation phase re-verified the steady states to ensure the system recovered after the faults.\\n\\nThe first experiment attempt revealed failures in the 'FrontEndLivenessProbeSuccess' test during the fault-injection and post-validation phases, indicating issues with the single replica configuration and resource constraints. Based on the analysis, improvements were made by increasing the number of replicas for the 'front-end' deployment and adjusting the liveness probe configuration.\\n\\nThe second experiment attempt, with the improved configuration, successfully passed all unit tests, confirming that the system maintained its steady states under the simulated fault conditions. This cycle demonstrated the importance of redundancy, resource optimization, and probe configuration in enhancing system resilience.\"}\n"
