    "report": "The Chaos Engineering experiment results indicate that the 'FrontEndLivenessProbeSuccess' test failed during both the fault-injection and post-validation phases, while the 'CartsServiceEndpointsAvailable' test passed throughout the experiment. This analysis will focus on understanding why the 'FrontEndLivenessProbeSuccess' test failed and provide insights for improvement.\n\n1. **Pre-Validation Phase Success**: Both the 'CartsServiceEndpointsAvailable' and 'FrontEndLivenessProbeSuccess' tests passed during the pre-validation phase, indicating that the system was in a steady state before the fault injection. This confirms that the initial configuration of the system was functioning as expected.\n\n2. **Fault-Phase Failure of Front-End Liveness Probe**: During the fault-injection phase, the 'FrontEndLivenessProbeSuccess' test failed with a liveness probe success rate of 60%. This failure can be attributed to the combination of 'StressChaos' and 'NetworkChaos' faults applied to the 'front-end' pod. The 'StressChaos' fault increased CPU load to 80%, which likely caused resource contention and degraded performance. Additionally, the 'NetworkChaos' fault introduced network latency, further impacting the responsiveness of the 'front-end' pod. The combination of high CPU load and network latency likely led to the liveness probe failures, as the pod could not respond in a timely manner.\n\n3. **Post-Validation Phase Failure**: The 'FrontEndLivenessProbeSuccess' test continued to fail in the post-validation phase, with a success rate dropping to 13.33%. This suggests that the system did not recover quickly after the 'PodChaos' fault, which killed the single replica of the 'front-end' pod. The lack of redundancy (only one replica) meant that there was no backup pod to take over, leading to prolonged downtime until the pod was recreated and became ready.\n\n4. **Insights and Recommendations**:\n   - **Increase Replicas for Front-End**: The single replica configuration for the 'front-end' deployment is a critical weakness. Increasing the number of replicas would provide redundancy, allowing the system to maintain availability even if one pod fails. This change would mitigate the impact of the 'PodChaos' fault and improve resilience.\n   - **Optimize Resource Requests and Limits**: The 'front-end' pod's resource requests and limits should be reviewed and potentially increased to handle high CPU loads more effectively. This could involve increasing the CPU and memory requests to ensure the pod has sufficient resources during peak loads.\n   - **Adjust Liveness Probe Configuration**: The liveness probe's initial delay and period settings should be optimized to detect failures more quickly and allow for faster recovery. Reducing the initial delay and period could help identify issues sooner and trigger restarts if necessary.\n   - **Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaling**: Consider implementing horizontal pod autoscaling for the 'front-end' deployment to automatically adjust the number of replicas based on CPU utilization or other metrics. This would allow the system to dynamically scale in response to increased load, improving resilience during high-demand scenarios like a Black Friday sale.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the system can be better prepared to handle similar fault scenarios in the future, maintaining steady states and improving overall resilience."
