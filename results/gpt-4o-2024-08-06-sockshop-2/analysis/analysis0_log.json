                "System: You are a helpful AI assistant for Chaos Engineering.\nGiven K8s manifests for a network system, its hypothesis, the overview of a Chaos-Engineeering experiment, and the experimental results, you will analyze the experimental results.\nAlways keep the following rules:\n- Analyze step by step why the test(s) failed, based on the system configuraions (manifests) and the flow of the experiment.\n- Specify the cause while mentioning the corresponding system configurations and the corresponding phenamena in the Chaos-Engineering experiment.\n- The anaysis report here will be used for reconfiguring the system later to avoid the failures and improve resiliency. Therefore, make carefully the report rich in insights so that it will be helpful at that time.\n- When providing insights and reconfiguration recommendations, limit them to areas related to the failed test.\n- The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema.

It offers users the ability to browse a catalogue of socks, add items to a cart, place orders, and manage user accounts. The application is composed of multiple microservices, each responsible for a specific function within the e-commerce workflow, such as handling orders, managing user sessions, and processing payments.; The manifests provided are part of a well-known microservices demo application called 'Sock Shop'. This application is designed to demonstrate the use of microservices architecture and Kubernetes orchestration. The file names, labels, and images used in the manifests (e.g., 'weaveworksdemos') are indicative of the Sock Shop application, which simulates an e-commerce website for selling socks. The application includes various services such as carts, catalogue, orders, payment, and user management, each with its own database and service components, reflecting a typical e-commerce platform's architecture.\n\n# Here is the hypothesis for my system:\nThe hypothesis is \"The steady states of the sytem are maintained even when the fault scenario occurs (i.e., when the faults are injected)\".\nThe steady states here are as follows:\n2 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: CartsServiceEndpointsAvailable\n- Description: The first issue to address is the 'Missing Port Configuration' in the Service manifests. This issue is likely to cause connectivity problems, making it a critical aspect to verify. Among the manifests with this issue, 'sock-shop-2/manifests/02-carts-svc.yaml' is selected as it is the first in the list. The steady state will ensure that the Service is functioning correctly by checking the number of endpoints available for the 'carts' service, which should match the number of replicas in the corresponding Deployment.\n- Threshold for the steady state: At least 1 endpoint must be available for the 'carts' service 95% of the time during a 1-minute period, with a target of 2 endpoints available.; The steady state to be verified is the availability of endpoints for the 'carts' service, which should match the number of replicas specified in the corresponding Deployment. The Deployment for 'carts' specifies 2 replicas, and the current state shows that there are 2 endpoints available consistently over a period of 5 seconds. This indicates that the system is currently in a healthy state. To account for potential fluctuations and ensure the system remains resilient, a reasonable threshold should allow for a small tolerance. Given the redundancy with 2 replicas, the threshold can be set to require at least 1 endpoint to be available at all times, but ideally, both should be available. Additionally, the threshold should specify that this condition must be met for at least 95% of the time during the 1-minute chaos experiment, allowing for brief disruptions without failing the steady state check.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestCartsServiceEndpoints(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.apps_v1 = client.AppsV1Api()  # Initialize AppsV1Api\n        self.namespace = 'sock-shop'\n        self.service_name = 'carts'\n        self.deployment_name = 'carts'\n\n    def get_endpoints_count(self):\n        endpoints = self.v1.read_namespaced_endpoints(self.service_name, self.namespace)\n        return len(endpoints.subsets[0].addresses) if endpoints.subsets else 0\n\n    def get_replicas_count(self):\n        deployment = self.apps_v1.read_namespaced_deployment(self.deployment_name, self.namespace)  # Use AppsV1Api\n        return deployment.status.replicas\n\n    def test_endpoints_availability(self, duration):\n        success_count = 0\n        total_checks = duration\n\n        for _ in range(duration):\n            endpoints_count = self.get_endpoints_count()\n            replicas_count = self.get_replicas_count()\n            print(f'Endpoints available: {endpoints_count}, Expected replicas: {replicas_count}')\n\n            # Check if at least 1 endpoint is available\n            if endpoints_count >= 1:\n                success_count += 1\n\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the success rate\n        success_rate = (success_count / total_checks) * 100\n        print(f'Success rate: {success_rate}%')\n\n        # Assert that the success rate is at least 95%\n        assert success_rate >= 95, f'Success rate {success_rate}% is below the threshold of 95%'\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test Carts Service Endpoints Availability')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=60, help='Duration to check the state in seconds')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    test = TestCartsServiceEndpoints()\n    test.test_endpoints_availability(args.duration)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\n```2nd steady states:\n- Name: FrontEndLivenessProbeSuccess\n- Description: The next issue to address is the 'Single Replica Deployment' in the 'sock-shop-2/manifests/09-front-end-dep.yaml'. This issue is critical because having only one replica can lead to downtime if the pod fails. To ensure the system's resilience, we need to verify that the single replica of the 'front-end' deployment is always available. The steady state will check the availability of the 'front-end' pod by ensuring that the liveness probe is successful 95% of the time during a 1-minute period. This will help us confirm that the single replica is stable and responsive, even though it lacks redundancy.\n- Threshold for the steady state: The liveness probe for the 'front-end' pod must be successful at least 95% of the time during a 1-minute monitoring period.; The steady state to be verified is the availability of the 'front-end' pod, specifically ensuring that the liveness probe is successful 95% of the time during a 1-minute period. The current state shows a 100% success rate, which is above the required 95%. To account for fluctuations and ensure the system remains stable, we can set a threshold that allows for some tolerance. Given that the current success rate is 100%, setting the threshold at 95% is reasonable and ensures that the system is considered stable even if there are minor fluctuations. This threshold is also aligned with the requirement to complete the Chaos-Engineering experiment within 1 minute, as it allows for quick verification of the system's stability.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestFrontEndLivenessProbe(K8sAPIBase):\n    def check_frontend_liveness(self, namespace, duration):\n        success_count = 0\n        total_checks = 0\n\n        for _ in range(duration):\n            # List pods with the label 'name=front-end' in the specified namespace\n            pods = self.v1.list_namespaced_pod(namespace=namespace, label_selector=\"name=front-end\").items\n            if pods:\n                pod = pods[0]\n                if pod.status.conditions:\n                    for condition in pod.status.conditions:\n                        if condition.type == \"Ready\" and condition.status == \"True\":\n                            success_count += 1\n                            break\n            total_checks += 1\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the success rate of the liveness probe\n        success_rate = (success_count / total_checks) * 100\n        print(f\"Liveness Probe Success Rate: {success_rate}%\")\n        return success_rate\n\n    def test_liveness_probe_success_rate(self, namespace='sock-shop', duration=60):\n        # Check the liveness probe success rate\n        success_rate = self.check_frontend_liveness(namespace, duration)\n        # Assert that the success rate is at least 95%\n        assert success_rate >= 95, f\"Liveness probe success rate is below 95%: {success_rate}%\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test Front-End Liveness Probe Success Rate')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=60, help='Duration to check the liveness probe in seconds')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    # Create an instance of the test class\n    test_instance = TestFrontEndLivenessProbe()\n    # Run the test with the specified duration\n    test_instance.test_liveness_probe_success_rate(duration=args.duration)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\nThe fault scenario here is as follows:\n\nAn assumed fault scenario is as follows:\n- Event: Black Friday Sale\n- Used Chaos Engineering tool: Chaos Mesh\n- Faults to simulate the event: [[Fault(name='StressChaos', name_id=0, params={'mode': 'all', 'value': '2', 'stressors': {'cpu': {'workers': 2, 'load': 100}}, 'containerNames': ['carts'], 'selector': {'namespaces': ['sock-shop'], 'labelSelectors': {'name': 'carts'}}}), Fault(name='StressChaos', name_id=1, params={'mode': 'all', 'stressors': {'cpu': {'workers': 2, 'load': 80}}, 'containerNames': ['front-end'], 'selector': {'namespaces': ['sock-shop'], 'labelSelectors': {'name': 'front-end'}}})], [Fault(name='NetworkChaos', name_id=0, params={'action': 'delay', 'mode': 'all', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['sock-shop'], 'labelSelectors': {'name': 'front-end'}}, 'direction': 'to', 'device': 'eth0', 'delay': {'latency': '100ms', 'jitter': '10ms', 'correlation': '50'}})], [Fault(name='PodChaos', name_id=0, params={'action': 'pod-kill', 'mode': 'one', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['sock-shop'], 'labelSelectors': {'name': 'front-end'}}, 'value': '1'})]]\n- Description: During a Black Friday sale, the system is expected to handle a significant increase in traffic and load. This event will test the system's ability to maintain steady states under high demand. The 'CartsServiceEndpointsAvailable' steady state is crucial as it ensures the availability of the carts service, which is essential for users to add items to their cart. The 'FrontEndLivenessProbeSuccess' steady state is also critical as it ensures the front-end is responsive, allowing users to browse and make purchases. The system's weaknesses include missing port configurations, a single replica deployment for the front-end, and high initial delays for probes. To simulate the Black Friday event, we will first inject a 'StressChaos' fault to simulate high CPU usage on the 'carts' and 'front-end' pods, testing their ability to handle increased load. Next, we will inject a 'NetworkChaos' fault to simulate network latency, testing the system's resilience to network issues during high traffic. Finally, we will inject a 'PodChaos' fault to kill the single replica of the 'front-end' pod, testing the system's ability to recover from pod failures without redundancy.\n\n# Here is the overview of my Chaos-Engineering experiment to verify the hypothesis:\nThe Chaos Engineering experiment for the Sock Shop application is structured into three distinct phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation, all within a total duration of one minute. \n\nIn the pre-validation phase, which lasts for 15 seconds, two unit tests are executed simultaneously to ensure the system is in a steady state before any faults are introduced. The 'CartsServiceEndpointsAvailable' test, with the workflow name 'pre-unittest-cartsserviceendpointsavailable', and the 'FrontEndLivenessProbeSuccess' test, with the workflow name 'pre-unittest-frontendlivenessprobesuccess', both start immediately with no delay and run for the entire 15 seconds. These tests check the availability of the 'carts' service endpoints and the responsiveness of the 'front-end' pod, respectively.\n\nThe fault-injection phase spans 30 seconds and involves a staggered introduction of faults to simulate a high-load scenario akin to a Black Friday sale. Initially, two 'StressChaos' faults are injected simultaneously at the start of the phase, targeting the 'carts' and 'front-end' pods to simulate high CPU usage. These have workflow names 'fault-stresschaos' and 'fault-stresschaos2', each lasting for 10 seconds. At the 10-second mark, 'NetworkChaos' is introduced to the 'front-end' pod to simulate network latency, with the workflow name 'fault-networkchaos', also lasting for 10 seconds. Finally, at the 20-second mark, 'PodChaos' is injected to simulate a pod failure on the 'front-end' pod, with the workflow name 'fault-podchaos', lasting for the remaining 10 seconds. Throughout this phase, the steady states 'CartsServiceEndpointsAvailable' and 'FrontEndLivenessProbeSuccess' are continuously verified with workflows 'fault-unittest-cartsserviceendpointsavailable' and 'fault-unittest-frontendlivenessprobesuccess', each running for the full 30 seconds.\n\nIn the post-validation phase, lasting 15 seconds, the system's return to steady states is verified. The same two unit tests from the pre-validation phase are executed simultaneously again. The 'CartsServiceEndpointsAvailable' test, with the workflow name 'post-unittest-cartsserviceendpointsavailable', and the 'FrontEndLivenessProbeSuccess' test, with the workflow name 'post-unittest-frontendlivenessprobesuccess', both start immediately with no delay and run for the entire 15 seconds. This ensures the system has recovered and is functioning as expected after the fault injections.\n\n# The experiment's results are as follows:\nPassed unittests:\n- pre-unittest-cartsserviceendpointsavailable\n- pre-unittest-frontendlivenessprobesuccess\n- fault-unittest-cartsserviceendpointsavailable\n- post-unittest-cartsserviceendpointsavailable\nFailed unittests:\n- fault-unittest-frontendlivenessprobesuccess\n```log\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/chaos-eater/sandbox/cycle_20241127_030827/hypothesis/unittest_FrontEndLivenessProbeSuccess_mod0.py\", line 49, in <module>\nLiveness Probe Success Rate: 60.0%\n    main()\n  File \"/chaos-eater/sandbox/cycle_20241127_030827/hypothesis/unittest_FrontEndLivenessProbeSuccess_mod0.py\", line 45, in main\n    test_instance.test_liveness_probe_success_rate(duration=args.duration)\n  File \"/chaos-eater/sandbox/cycle_20241127_030827/hypothesis/unittest_FrontEndLivenessProbeSuccess_mod0.py\", line 34, in test_liveness_probe_success_rate\n    assert success_rate >= 95, f\"Liveness probe success rate is below 95%: {success_rate}%\"\nAssertionError: Liveness probe success rate is below 95%: 60.0%\n\n```\n\n- post-unittest-frontendlivenessprobesuccess\n```log\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/chaos-eater/sandbox/cycle_20241127_030827/hypothesis/unittest_FrontEndLivenessProbeSuccess_mod0.py\", line 49, in <module>\nLiveness Probe Success Rate: 13.333333333333334%\n    main()\n  File \"/chaos-eater/sandbox/cycle_20241127_030827/hypothesis/unittest_FrontEndLivenessProbeSuccess_mod0.py\", line 45, in main\n    test_instance.test_liveness_probe_success_rate(duration=args.duration)\n  File \"/chaos-eater/sandbox/cycle_20241127_030827/hypothesis/unittest_FrontEndLivenessProbeSuccess_mod0.py\", line 34, in test_liveness_probe_success_rate\n    assert success_rate >= 95, f\"Liveness probe success rate is below 95%: {success_rate}%\"\nAssertionError: Liveness probe success rate is below 95%: 13.333333333333334%\n\n```\n\n\nNow, please analyze the results and provide an analysis report rich in insights.\nAI: ```json\n{\"report\":"

            "{\"report\": \"The Chaos Engineering experiment results indicate that the 'FrontEndLivenessProbeSuccess' test failed during both the fault-injection and post-validation phases, while the 'CartsServiceEndpointsAvailable' test passed throughout the experiment. This analysis will focus on understanding why the 'FrontEndLivenessProbeSuccess' test failed and provide insights for improvement.\\n\\n1. **Pre-Validation Phase Success**: Both the 'CartsServiceEndpointsAvailable' and 'FrontEndLivenessProbeSuccess' tests passed during the pre-validation phase, indicating that the system was in a steady state before the fault injection. This confirms that the initial configuration of the system was functioning as expected.\\n\\n2. **Fault-Phase Failure of Front-End Liveness Probe**: During the fault-injection phase, the 'FrontEndLivenessProbeSuccess' test failed with a liveness probe success rate of 60%. This failure can be attributed to the combination of 'StressChaos' and 'NetworkChaos' faults applied to the 'front-end' pod. The 'StressChaos' fault increased CPU load to 80%, which likely caused resource contention and degraded performance. Additionally, the 'NetworkChaos' fault introduced network latency, further impacting the responsiveness of the 'front-end' pod. The combination of high CPU load and network latency likely led to the liveness probe failures, as the pod could not respond in a timely manner.\\n\\n3. **Post-Validation Phase Failure**: The 'FrontEndLivenessProbeSuccess' test continued to fail in the post-validation phase, with a success rate dropping to 13.33%. This suggests that the system did not recover quickly after the 'PodChaos' fault, which killed the single replica of the 'front-end' pod. The lack of redundancy (only one replica) meant that there was no backup pod to take over, leading to prolonged downtime until the pod was recreated and became ready.\\n\\n4. **Insights and Recommendations**:\\n   - **Increase Replicas for Front-End**: The single replica configuration for the 'front-end' deployment is a critical weakness. Increasing the number of replicas would provide redundancy, allowing the system to maintain availability even if one pod fails. This change would mitigate the impact of the 'PodChaos' fault and improve resilience.\\n   - **Optimize Resource Requests and Limits**: The 'front-end' pod's resource requests and limits should be reviewed and potentially increased to handle high CPU loads more effectively. This could involve increasing the CPU and memory requests to ensure the pod has sufficient resources during peak loads.\\n   - **Adjust Liveness Probe Configuration**: The liveness probe's initial delay and period settings should be optimized to detect failures more quickly and allow for faster recovery. Reducing the initial delay and period could help identify issues sooner and trigger restarts if necessary.\\n   - **Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaling**: Consider implementing horizontal pod autoscaling for the 'front-end' deployment to automatically adjust the number of replicas based on CPU utilization or other metrics. This would allow the system to dynamically scale in response to increased load, improving resilience during high-demand scenarios like a Black Friday sale.\\n\\nBy addressing these areas, the system can be better prepared to handle similar fault scenarios in the future, maintaining steady states and improving overall resilience.\"}\n"
