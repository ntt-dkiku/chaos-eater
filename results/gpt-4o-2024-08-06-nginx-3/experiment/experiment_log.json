The Pod manifest specifies a container running the Nginx image, which is a popular open-source web server used for serving static content, reverse proxying, and load balancing. The Service manifest is configured to expose this Pod on port 80, which is the default port for HTTP traffic. Given the use of Nginx and the configuration of the Service, it is logical to assume that these manifests are intended to deploy a simple web server application. The file names and the use of Nginx further support this assumption.\n\n# Steady states of my system:\n2 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: PodRunningState_nginx_pod\n- Description: The first issue to address is the Pod's restart policy set to 'Never', which means the Pod will not restart automatically if it fails. This is a critical issue because it can lead to downtime if the Pod encounters any failure. Therefore, the steady state should ensure that the Pod is running and available. A measurable output for this steady state is the number of running Pods. Since there is only one Pod defined in the manifest, the steady state should verify that this Pod is in the 'Running' state.\n- Threshold for the steady state: The Pod should be in the 'Running' state at least 90% of the time during the observation period.; The steady state we are considering is the 'PodRunningState_nginx_pod', which requires the Pod to be in the 'Running' state. The current state shows that the Pod was running 5 out of 5 seconds, which indicates a stable and consistent running state. To define a reasonable threshold, we should consider a percentage of time the Pod should be running within a given duration. Since the current state shows 100% uptime, we can introduce a small tolerance to account for potential brief fluctuations or delays in status updates. A reasonable threshold would be that the Pod should be running at least 90% of the time during the observation period. This allows for some minor fluctuations while still ensuring the Pod is generally stable and available.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestPodRunningState(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self, namespace, pod_name, duration):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.namespace = namespace\n        self.pod_name = pod_name\n        self.duration = duration\n\n    def test_pod_running_state(self):\n        running_count = 0\n\n        # Loop for the specified duration, checking the Pod's status every second\n        for _ in range(self.duration):\n            try:\n                pod = self.v1.read_namespaced_pod(name=self.pod_name, namespace=self.namespace)\n                if pod.status.phase == 'Running':\n                    running_count += 1\n                print(f\"Pod {self.pod_name} status: {pod.status.phase}\")\n            except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n                print(f\"Exception when calling CoreV1Api->read_namespaced_pod: {e}\")\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the percentage of time the Pod was running\n        running_percentage = (running_count / self.duration) * 100\n        print(f\"Pod {self.pod_name} was running {running_count} out of {self.duration} seconds.\")\n\n        # Assert that the Pod was running at least 90% of the time\n        assert running_percentage >= 90, f\"Pod {self.pod_name} was not running at least 90% of the time.

This is a critical issue because if the single Pod fails, the entire service becomes unavailable. To ensure the system's resiliency, we need to verify that the Service is able to route traffic to the Pod. A measurable output for this steady state is the Service's ability to successfully forward requests to the Pod. Since the Service is configured to expose the Pod on port 80, the steady state should verify that the Service is able to handle HTTP requests and return a successful response (e.g., HTTP 200 status code). This will ensure that the Service is functioning correctly and can route traffic to the Pod, even if there is only one Pod available.\n- Threshold for the steady state: HTTP 200 response success rate >= 95%; The steady state we are evaluating is the Service's ability to route traffic to the Pod and return a successful HTTP response. The k6 test results show that 100% of the requests received a 200 status code, indicating that the Service is currently functioning correctly. To define a reasonable threshold, we should consider a success rate that accounts for minor fluctuations while still ensuring the system is operating normally. Given the current success rate is 100%, a threshold of 95% success rate for HTTP 200 responses would be reasonable. This allows for some tolerance in case of transient issues, while still maintaining a high standard for system availability.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following K6 Javascript:\n```\nimport http from 'k6/http';\nimport { check } from 'k6';\n\nexport const options = {\n  vus: 1,\n  duration: '5s',\n  thresholds: {\n    // Ensure that the success rate for HTTP 200 responses is at least 95%\n    'http_req_failed': ['rate<0.05'],\n  },\n};\n\nexport default function () {\n  const res = http.get('http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:80');\n  check(res, {\n    'is status 200': (r) => r.status === 200,\n  });\n}\n```\n\n# A fault scenario that may occur in my system and may affect the steady states:\n\nAn assumed fault scenario is as follows:\n- Event: Cyber Attack Simulation\n- Used Chaos Engineering tool: Chaos Mesh\n- Faults to simulate the event: [[Fault(name='NetworkChaos', name_id=0, params={'action': 'delay', 'direction': 'to', 'mode': 'all', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}, 'delay': {'latency': '100ms', 'jitter': '10ms'}})], [Fault(name='PodChaos', name_id=0, params={'action': 'pod-kill', 'mode': 'one', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}})]]\n- Description: Given the system's weaknesses, a cyber attack targeting the availability of the web server could be highly impactful. The Pod's restart policy set to 'Never' and the single Pod deployment create vulnerabilities that could lead to downtime if the Pod fails. To simulate a cyber attack, we can introduce network disruptions and resource exhaustion to test the system's resilience. First, we will simulate network latency to see if the Service can still route traffic effectively, which tests the 'ServiceRoutingState_nginx_service'. Then, we will introduce a Pod failure to test the 'PodRunningState_nginx_pod', checking if the system can recover from a Pod failure without automatic restarts. This sequence simulates a cyber attack by first degrading network performance and then causing a Pod failure, testing the system's ability to maintain its steady states under stress.\n\n# Please follow the instructions below regarding Chaos Engineering as necessary:\n- The Chaos-Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute.\n\nNow, please plan a Chaos Engineering experiment to check the network system's resiliency that the steady states are remained during fault injection.\nAI: ```json\n{\"thought\":"

The pre-validation phase is crucial to ensure that the system is in its expected steady state before introducing any faults. Since we have two steady states to validate, we should allocate a short but sufficient time to verify both the Pod's running state and the Service's routing capability. A reasonable allocation would be 15 seconds for pre-validation. The fault-injection phase is where we introduce the chaos to observe the system's behavior under stress. Since we have two types of faults to inject (network delay and pod kill), we should allocate the majority of the time here to observe the system's response. A 30-second duration for fault injection allows us to introduce both faults and monitor their effects. Finally, the post-validation phase is necessary to ensure that the system returns to its steady states after the faults are removed. We should allocate 15 seconds for post-validation to verify that both the Pod and Service have returned to their expected states.

The Pod manifest specifies a container running the Nginx image, which is a popular open-source web server used for serving static content, reverse proxying, and load balancing. The Service manifest is configured to expose this Pod on port 80, which is the default port for HTTP traffic. Given the use of Nginx and the configuration of the Service, it is logical to assume that these manifests are intended to deploy a simple web server application. The file names and the use of Nginx further support this assumption.\n\n# Steady states of my system:\n2 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: PodRunningState_nginx_pod\n- Description: The first issue to address is the Pod's restart policy set to 'Never', which means the Pod will not restart automatically if it fails. This is a critical issue because it can lead to downtime if the Pod encounters any failure. Therefore, the steady state should ensure that the Pod is running and available. A measurable output for this steady state is the number of running Pods. Since there is only one Pod defined in the manifest, the steady state should verify that this Pod is in the 'Running' state.\n- Threshold for the steady state: The Pod should be in the 'Running' state at least 90% of the time during the observation period.; The steady state we are considering is the 'PodRunningState_nginx_pod', which requires the Pod to be in the 'Running' state. The current state shows that the Pod was running 5 out of 5 seconds, which indicates a stable and consistent running state. To define a reasonable threshold, we should consider a percentage of time the Pod should be running within a given duration. Since the current state shows 100% uptime, we can introduce a small tolerance to account for potential brief fluctuations or delays in status updates. A reasonable threshold would be that the Pod should be running at least 90% of the time during the observation period. This allows for some minor fluctuations while still ensuring the Pod is generally stable and available.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestPodRunningState(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self, namespace, pod_name, duration):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.namespace = namespace\n        self.pod_name = pod_name\n        self.duration = duration\n\n    def test_pod_running_state(self):\n        running_count = 0\n\n        # Loop for the specified duration, checking the Pod's status every second\n        for _ in range(self.duration):\n            try:\n                pod = self.v1.read_namespaced_pod(name=self.pod_name, namespace=self.namespace)\n                if pod.status.phase == 'Running':\n                    running_count += 1\n                print(f\"Pod {self.pod_name} status: {pod.status.phase}\")\n            except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n                print(f\"Exception when calling CoreV1Api->read_namespaced_pod: {e}\")\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the percentage of time the Pod was running\n        running_percentage = (running_count / self.duration) * 100\n        print(f\"Pod {self.pod_name} was running {running_count} out of {self.duration} seconds.\")\n\n        # Assert that the Pod was running at least 90% of the time\n        assert running_percentage >= 90, f\"Pod {self.pod_name} was not running at least 90% of the time.

This is a critical issue because if the single Pod fails, the entire service becomes unavailable. To ensure the system's resiliency, we need to verify that the Service is able to route traffic to the Pod. A measurable output for this steady state is the Service's ability to successfully forward requests to the Pod. Since the Service is configured to expose the Pod on port 80, the steady state should verify that the Service is able to handle HTTP requests and return a successful response (e.g., HTTP 200 status code). This will ensure that the Service is functioning correctly and can route traffic to the Pod, even if there is only one Pod available.\n- Threshold for the steady state: HTTP 200 response success rate >= 95%; The steady state we are evaluating is the Service's ability to route traffic to the Pod and return a successful HTTP response. The k6 test results show that 100% of the requests received a 200 status code, indicating that the Service is currently functioning correctly. To define a reasonable threshold, we should consider a success rate that accounts for minor fluctuations while still ensuring the system is operating normally. Given the current success rate is 100%, a threshold of 95% success rate for HTTP 200 responses would be reasonable. This allows for some tolerance in case of transient issues, while still maintaining a high standard for system availability.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following K6 Javascript:\n```\nimport http from 'k6/http';\nimport { check } from 'k6';\n\nexport const options = {\n  vus: 1,\n  duration: '5s',\n  thresholds: {\n    // Ensure that the success rate for HTTP 200 responses is at least 95%\n    'http_req_failed': ['rate<0.05'],\n  },\n};\n\nexport default function () {\n  const res = http.get('http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:80');\n  check(res, {\n    'is status 200': (r) => r.status === 200,\n  });\n}\n```\n\n# A fault scenario that may occur in my system and may affect the steady states:\n\nAn assumed fault scenario is as follows:\n- Event: Cyber Attack Simulation\n- Used Chaos Engineering tool: Chaos Mesh\n- Faults to simulate the event: [[Fault(name='NetworkChaos', name_id=0, params={'action': 'delay', 'direction': 'to', 'mode': 'all', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}, 'delay': {'latency': '100ms', 'jitter': '10ms'}})], [Fault(name='PodChaos', name_id=0, params={'action': 'pod-kill', 'mode': 'one', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}})]]\n- Description: Given the system's weaknesses, a cyber attack targeting the availability of the web server could be highly impactful. The Pod's restart policy set to 'Never' and the single Pod deployment create vulnerabilities that could lead to downtime if the Pod fails. To simulate a cyber attack, we can introduce network disruptions and resource exhaustion to test the system's resilience. First, we will simulate network latency to see if the Service can still route traffic effectively, which tests the 'ServiceRoutingState_nginx_service'. Then, we will introduce a Pod failure to test the 'PodRunningState_nginx_pod', checking if the system can recover from a Pod failure without automatic restarts. This sequence simulates a cyber attack by first degrading network performance and then causing a Pod failure, testing the system's ability to maintain its steady states under stress.\n\n# Please follow the instructions below regarding Chaos Engineering as necessary:\n- The Chaos-Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute.\n\nNow, please detail the fault-injection phase.

(grace_period + duration) should not exceed the corresponding phase's total time.\n- Never output bullet points.\n- The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"summary\": {\"title\": \"Summary\", \"description\": \"The summary of the given Chaos-Engineering-experiment plan.\", \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"required\": [\"summary\"]}\n```\n\nHuman: # Here is my Chaos-Engineering-experiment plan:\n## Time Schedule\nGiven the constraints of the experiment needing to be completed within 1 minute, we need to allocate time efficiently across the three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation. The pre-validation phase is crucial to ensure that the system is in its expected steady state before introducing any faults. Since we have two steady states to validate, we should allocate a short but sufficient time to verify both the Pod's running state and the Service's routing capability. A reasonable allocation would be 15 seconds for pre-validation. The fault-injection phase is where we introduce the chaos to observe the system's behavior under stress. Since we have two types of faults to inject (network delay and pod kill), we should allocate the majority of the time here to observe the system's response. A 30-second duration for fault injection allows us to introduce both faults and monitor their effects. Finally, the post-validation phase is necessary to ensure that the system returns to its steady states after the faults are removed. We should allocate 15 seconds for post-validation to verify that both the Pod and Service have returned to their expected states. This allocation ensures that we have a balanced approach to validating the system's resiliency within the 1-minute constraint.\n\n## Pre-validation Phase\nIn the pre-validation phase, we need to ensure that the system is in its expected steady states before we proceed with fault injection. Given the two steady states defined, we will conduct unit tests to verify each of them. The tests will be executed sequentially within the 15-second time frame allocated for this phase. The first test will verify the 'PodRunningState_nginx_pod', ensuring that the Pod is running at least 90% of the time. This test will be conducted first because it directly checks the availability of the Pod, which is critical for the subsequent service routing test. The second test will verify the 'ServiceRoutingState_nginx_service', ensuring that the Service can successfully route HTTP requests with a 95% success rate for HTTP 200 responses. This test will follow immediately after the first test. The sequential execution ensures that we first confirm the Pod's availability before checking the Service's routing capability, as the latter depends on the former. Each test is designed to run for a short duration to fit within the 15-second limit, with a brief grace period to allow for any initial setup or delays.\n- Verified Steady State #0: ```PodRunningState_nginx_pod```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```pre-unittest-podrunningstatenginxpod```  \n  - Grace Period: ```0s```  \n  - Duration: ```7s```  \n- Verified Steady State #1: ```ServiceRoutingState_nginx_service```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```pre-unittest-serviceroutingstatenginxservice```  \n  - Grace Period: ```7s```  \n  - Duration: ```8s```  \n\n\n## Fault-injection Phase \nIn this fault-injection phase, we aim to simulate a cyber attack by introducing two types of faults: network latency and pod failure. The total duration for this phase is 30 seconds, so we need to carefully schedule the fault injections and unit tests to fit within this timeframe. \n\nFirst, we will introduce a network delay using NetworkChaos to simulate network latency. This will help us observe how the system handles degraded network performance and affects the 'ServiceRoutingState_nginx_service'. We will start this fault injection immediately at the beginning of the phase and let it run for 15 seconds. \n\nSimultaneously, we will run the unit test for 'ServiceRoutingState_nginx_service' to verify if the service can still route traffic effectively under network delay conditions. This test will also start at the beginning and run for 15 seconds.\n\nAfter the network delay fault injection and the corresponding unit test, we will introduce a pod failure using PodChaos. This will help us observe the system's behavior when the pod is killed, affecting the 'PodRunningState_nginx_pod'. We will start this fault injection at the 15-second mark and let it run for 10 seconds.\n\nSimultaneously, we will run the unit test for 'PodRunningState_nginx_pod' to verify if the pod remains in the running state at least 90% of the time during the observation period. This test will start at the 15-second mark and run for 10 seconds.\n\nThis staggered approach allows us to observe the system's behavior under each fault condition separately while ensuring that both steady states are tested within the 30-second limit.\n- Verified Steady State #0: ```ServiceRoutingState_nginx_service```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```fault-unittest-serviceroutingstatenginxservice```  \n  - Grace Period: ```0s```  \n  - Duration: ```15s```  \n- Verified Steady State #1: ```PodRunningState_nginx_pod```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```fault-unittest-podrunningstatenginxpod```  \n  - Grace Period: ```15s```  \n  - Duration: ```10s```  \n\n\n- Injected Faults #0: ```NetworkChaos```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```fault-networkchaos```  \n  - Grace Period: ```0s```  \n  - Duration: ```15s```  \n- Injected Faults #1: ```PodChaos```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```fault-podchaos```  \n  - Grace Period: ```15s```  \n  - Duration: ```10s```  \n\n\n## Post-validation phase\nIn the post-validation phase, we need to ensure that the system has returned to its steady states after the fault injection. Given the 15-second time constraint, we will conduct unit tests to verify each steady state. The tests will be executed sequentially due to the short duration, ensuring that each steady state is verified independently. The first test will check the 'PodRunningState_nginx_pod' to confirm that the Pod is running and available. The second test will verify the 'ServiceRoutingState_nginx_service' to ensure that the Service can successfully route traffic to the Pod. Each test will have a brief grace period to allow the system to stabilize after the fault injection, followed by a short duration to perform the verification. This approach ensures that both steady states are validated within the available time, confirming the system's recovery.\n- Verified Steady State #0: ```PodRunningState_nginx_pod```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```post-unittest-podrunningstatenginxpod```  \n  - Grace Period: ```2s```  \n  - Duration: ```6s```  \n- Verified Steady State #1: ```ServiceRoutingState_nginx_service```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```post-unittest-serviceroutingstatenginxservice```  \n  - Grace Period: ```8s```  \n  - Duration: ```7s```  \n\n\nPlease summarize the above plan.\n\nAI: ```json\n{\"summary\":"
