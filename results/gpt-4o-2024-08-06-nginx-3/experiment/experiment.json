            "thought": "Given the constraints of the experiment needing to be completed within 1 minute, we need to allocate time efficiently across the three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation. The pre-validation phase is crucial to ensure that the system is in its expected steady state before introducing any faults. Since we have two steady states to validate, we should allocate a short but sufficient time to verify both the Pod's running state and the Service's routing capability. A reasonable allocation would be 15 seconds for pre-validation. The fault-injection phase is where we introduce the chaos to observe the system's behavior under stress. Since we have two types of faults to inject (network delay and pod kill), we should allocate the majority of the time here to observe the system's response. A 30-second duration for fault injection allows us to introduce both faults and monitor their effects. Finally, the post-validation phase is necessary to ensure that the system returns to its steady states after the faults are removed. We should allocate 15 seconds for post-validation to verify that both the Pod and Service have returned to their expected states. This allocation ensures that we have a balanced approach to validating the system's resiliency within the 1-minute constraint.",

Given the two steady states defined, we will conduct unit tests to verify each of them. The tests will be executed sequentially within the 15-second time frame allocated for this phase. The first test will verify the 'PodRunningState_nginx_pod', ensuring that the Pod is running at least 90% of the time. This test will be conducted first because it directly checks the availability of the Pod, which is critical for the subsequent service routing test. The second test will verify the 'ServiceRoutingState_nginx_service', ensuring that the Service can successfully route HTTP requests with a 95% success rate for HTTP 200 responses. This test will follow immediately after the first test. The sequential execution ensures that we first confirm the Pod's availability before checking the Service's routing capability, as the latter depends on the former. Each test is designed to run for a short duration to fit within the 15-second limit, with a brief grace period to allow for any initial setup or delays.",

The total duration for this phase is 30 seconds, so we need to carefully schedule the fault injections and unit tests to fit within this timeframe. \n\nFirst, we will introduce a network delay using NetworkChaos to simulate network latency. This will help us observe how the system handles degraded network performance and affects the 'ServiceRoutingState_nginx_service'. We will start this fault injection immediately at the beginning of the phase and let it run for 15 seconds. \n\nSimultaneously, we will run the unit test for 'ServiceRoutingState_nginx_service' to verify if the service can still route traffic effectively under network delay conditions. This test will also start at the beginning and run for 15 seconds.\n\nAfter the network delay fault injection and the corresponding unit test, we will introduce a pod failure using PodChaos. This will help us observe the system's behavior when the pod is killed, affecting the 'PodRunningState_nginx_pod'. We will start this fault injection at the 15-second mark and let it run for 10 seconds.\n\nSimultaneously, we will run the unit test for 'PodRunningState_nginx_pod' to verify if the pod remains in the running state at least 90% of the time during the observation period. This test will start at the 15-second mark and run for 10 seconds.\n\nThis staggered approach allows us to observe the system's behavior under each fault condition separately while ensuring that both steady states are tested within the 30-second limit.",

        "summary": "The Chaos-Engineering-experiment plan is structured into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation, all to be completed within a 1-minute timeframe. \n\nIn the pre-validation phase, which lasts for 15 seconds, two unit tests are executed sequentially. The first test, 'PodRunningState_nginx_pod', is conducted with a workflow named 'pre-unittest-podrunningstatenginxpod'. It starts immediately with no delay and runs for 7 seconds to ensure the Pod is running at least 90% of the time. Following this, the second test, 'ServiceRoutingState_nginx_service', is executed with the workflow 'pre-unittest-serviceroutingstatenginxservice'. It begins after a 7-second grace period and runs for 8 seconds to verify that the Service can route HTTP requests with a 95% success rate for HTTP 200 responses.\n\nThe fault-injection phase spans 30 seconds and involves two simultaneous fault injections and unit tests. At the start of this phase, a network delay is introduced using 'NetworkChaos' with the workflow 'fault-networkchaos', running for 15 seconds. Concurrently, the 'ServiceRoutingState_nginx_service' unit test is executed with the workflow 'fault-unittest-serviceroutingstatenginxservice', also for 15 seconds, to assess the service's routing capability under network delay conditions. At the 15-second mark, a pod failure is introduced using 'PodChaos' with the workflow 'fault-podchaos', running for 10 seconds. Simultaneously, the 'PodRunningState_nginx_pod' unit test is conducted with the workflow 'fault-unittest-podrunningstatenginxpod', also for 10 seconds, to verify the pod's availability during the fault.\n\nIn the post-validation phase, lasting 15 seconds, two unit tests are executed sequentially to confirm the system's recovery. The first test, 'PodRunningState_nginx_pod', is conducted with the workflow 'post-unittest-podrunningstatenginxpod'. It starts after a 2-second grace period and runs for 6 seconds to ensure the Pod is running and available. The second test, 'ServiceRoutingState_nginx_service', follows with the workflow 'post-unittest-serviceroutingstatenginxservice'. It begins after an 8-second grace period and runs for 7 seconds to verify the Service's ability to route traffic to the Pod. This structured approach ensures a comprehensive assessment of the system's resilience and recovery within the 1-minute constraint."
