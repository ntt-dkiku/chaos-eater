The Pod manifest specifies a container running the Nginx image, which is a popular open-source web server used for serving static content, reverse proxying, and load balancing. The Service manifest is configured to expose this Pod on port 80, which is the default port for HTTP traffic. Given the use of Nginx and the configuration of the Service, it is logical to assume that these manifests are intended to deploy a simple web server application. The file names and the use of Nginx further support this assumption.\n\n# Here is the hypothesis for my system:\nThe hypothesis is \"The steady states of the sytem are maintained even when the fault scenario occurs (i.e., when the faults are injected)\".\nThe steady states here are as follows:\n2 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: PodRunningState_nginx_pod\n- Description: The first issue to address is the Pod's restart policy set to 'Never', which means the Pod will not restart automatically if it fails. This is a critical issue because it can lead to downtime if the Pod encounters any failure. Therefore, the steady state should ensure that the Pod is running and available. A measurable output for this steady state is the number of running Pods. Since there is only one Pod defined in the manifest, the steady state should verify that this Pod is in the 'Running' state.\n- Threshold for the steady state: The Pod should be in the 'Running' state at least 90% of the time during the observation period.; The steady state we are considering is the 'PodRunningState_nginx_pod', which requires the Pod to be in the 'Running' state. The current state shows that the Pod was running 5 out of 5 seconds, which indicates a stable and consistent running state. To define a reasonable threshold, we should consider a percentage of time the Pod should be running within a given duration. Since the current state shows 100% uptime, we can introduce a small tolerance to account for potential brief fluctuations or delays in status updates. A reasonable threshold would be that the Pod should be running at least 90% of the time during the observation period. This allows for some minor fluctuations while still ensuring the Pod is generally stable and available.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestPodRunningState(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self, namespace, pod_name, duration):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.namespace = namespace\n        self.pod_name = pod_name\n        self.duration = duration\n\n    def test_pod_running_state(self):\n        running_count = 0\n\n        # Loop for the specified duration, checking the Pod's status every second\n        for _ in range(self.duration):\n            try:\n                pod = self.v1.read_namespaced_pod(name=self.pod_name, namespace=self.namespace)\n                if pod.status.phase == 'Running':\n                    running_count += 1\n                print(f\"Pod {self.pod_name} status: {pod.status.phase}\")\n            except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n                print(f\"Exception when calling CoreV1Api->read_namespaced_pod: {e}\")\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the percentage of time the Pod was running\n        running_percentage = (running_count / self.duration) * 100\n        print(f\"Pod {self.pod_name} was running {running_count} out of {self.duration} seconds.\")\n\n        # Assert that the Pod was running at least 90% of the time\n        assert running_percentage >= 90, f\"Pod {self.pod_name} was not running at least 90% of the time. Running percentage: {running_percentage}%\"\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test the running status of a Kubernetes Pod.')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=5, help='Duration to check the Pod status in seconds')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    # Create an instance of the test class and run the test\n    test = TestPodRunningState(namespace='default', pod_name='example-pod', duration=args.duration)\n    test.test_pod_running_state()\n\n```2nd steady states:\n- Name: ServiceRoutingState_nginx_service\n- Description: The next issue to address is the 'Single Pod Deployment', which can lead to a single point of failure. This is a critical issue because if the single Pod fails, the entire service becomes unavailable. To ensure the system's resiliency, we need to verify that the Service is able to route traffic to the Pod. A measurable output for this steady state is the Service's ability to successfully forward requests to the Pod. Since the Service is configured to expose the Pod on port 80, the steady state should verify that the Service is able to handle HTTP requests and return a successful response (e.g., HTTP 200 status code). This will ensure that the Service is functioning correctly and can route traffic to the Pod, even if there is only one Pod available.\n- Threshold for the steady state: HTTP 200 response success rate >= 95%; The steady state we are evaluating is the Service's ability to route traffic to the Pod and return a successful HTTP response. The k6 test results show that 100% of the requests received a 200 status code, indicating that the Service is currently functioning correctly. To define a reasonable threshold, we should consider a success rate that accounts for minor fluctuations while still ensuring the system is operating normally. Given the current success rate is 100%, a threshold of 95% success rate for HTTP 200 responses would be reasonable. This allows for some tolerance in case of transient issues, while still maintaining a high standard for system availability.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following K6 Javascript:\n```\nimport http from 'k6/http';\nimport { check } from 'k6';\n\nexport const options = {\n  vus: 1,\n  duration: '5s',\n  thresholds: {\n    // Ensure that the success rate for HTTP 200 responses is at least 95%\n    'http_req_failed': ['rate<0.05'],\n  },\n};\n\nexport default function () {\n  const res = http.get('http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:80');\n  check(res, {\n    'is status 200': (r) => r.status === 200,\n  });\n}\n```\n\nThe fault scenario here is as follows:\n\nAn assumed fault scenario is as follows:\n- Event: Cyber Attack Simulation\n- Used Chaos Engineering tool: Chaos Mesh\n- Faults to simulate the event: [[Fault(name='NetworkChaos', name_id=0, params={'action': 'delay', 'direction': 'to', 'mode': 'all', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}, 'delay': {'latency': '100ms', 'jitter': '10ms'}})], [Fault(name='PodChaos', name_id=0, params={'action': 'pod-kill', 'mode': 'one', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}})]]\n- Description: Given the system's weaknesses, a cyber attack targeting the availability of the web server could be highly impactful. The Pod's restart policy set to 'Never' and the single Pod deployment create vulnerabilities that could lead to downtime if the Pod fails. To simulate a cyber attack, we can introduce network disruptions and resource exhaustion to test the system's resilience. First, we will simulate network latency to see if the Service can still route traffic effectively, which tests the 'ServiceRoutingState_nginx_service'. Then, we will introduce a Pod failure to test the 'PodRunningState_nginx_pod', checking if the system can recover from a Pod failure without automatic restarts. This sequence simulates a cyber attack by first degrading network performance and then causing a Pod failure, testing the system's ability to maintain its steady states under stress.\n\n# Here is the overview of my Chaos-Engineering experiment to verify the hypothesis:\nThe Chaos-Engineering-experiment plan is structured into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation, all to be completed within a 1-minute timeframe. \n\nIn the pre-validation phase, which lasts for 15 seconds, two unit tests are executed sequentially. The first test, 'PodRunningState_nginx_pod', is conducted with a workflow named 'pre-unittest-podrunningstatenginxpod'. It starts immediately with no delay and runs for 7 seconds to ensure the Pod is running at least 90% of the time. Following this, the second test, 'ServiceRoutingState_nginx_service', is executed with the workflow 'pre-unittest-serviceroutingstatenginxservice'. It begins after a 7-second grace period and runs for 8 seconds to verify that the Service can route HTTP requests with a 95% success rate for HTTP 200 responses.\n\nThe fault-injection phase spans 30 seconds and involves two simultaneous fault injections and unit tests. At the start of this phase, a network delay is introduced using 'NetworkChaos' with the workflow 'fault-networkchaos', running for 15 seconds. Concurrently, the 'ServiceRoutingState_nginx_service' unit test is executed with the workflow 'fault-unittest-serviceroutingstatenginxservice', also for 15 seconds, to assess the service's routing capability under network delay conditions. At the 15-second mark, a pod failure is introduced using 'PodChaos' with the workflow 'fault-podchaos', running for 10 seconds. Simultaneously, the 'PodRunningState_nginx_pod' unit test is conducted with the workflow 'fault-unittest-podrunningstatenginxpod', also for 10 seconds, to verify the pod's availability during the fault.\n\nIn the post-validation phase, lasting 15 seconds, two unit tests are executed sequentially to confirm the system's recovery. The first test, 'PodRunningState_nginx_pod', is conducted with the workflow 'post-unittest-podrunningstatenginxpod'. It starts after a 2-second grace period and runs for 6 seconds to ensure the Pod is running and available. The second test, 'ServiceRoutingState_nginx_service', follows with the workflow 'post-unittest-serviceroutingstatenginxservice'. It begins after an 8-second grace period and runs for 7 seconds to verify the Service's ability to route traffic to the Pod. This structured approach ensures a comprehensive assessment of the system's resilience and recovery within the 1-minute constraint.\n\n# The experiment's results of the original system are as follows:\nPassed unittests:\n- pre-unittest-podrunningstatenginxpod\n- pre-unittest-serviceroutingstatenginxservice\n- fault-unittest-serviceroutingstatenginxservice\nFailed unittests:\n- fault-unittest-podrunningstatenginxpod\n```log\nException when calling CoreV1Api->read_namespaced_pod: (404)\nReason: Not Found\nHTTP response headers: HTTPHeaderDict({'Audit-Id': '80fb2524-9026-47c3-9bdb-3fad057f9102', 'Cache-Control': 'no-cache, private', 'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'X-Kubernetes-Pf-Flowschema-Uid': 'c4624bd9-7fc7-42c6-bcb8-4235110a860d', 'X-Kubernetes-Pf-Prioritylevel-Uid': '4706085f-6263-43ae-93f5-b4a61de8b6be', 'Date': 'Sun, 24 Nov 2024 13:04:15 GMT', 'Content-Length': '190'})\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n ...application/json', 'X-Kubernetes-Pf-Flowschema-Uid': 'c4624bd9-7fc7-42c6-bcb8-4235110a860d', 'X-Kubernetes-Pf-Prioritylevel-Uid': '4706085f-6263-43ae-93f5-b4a61de8b6be', 'Date': 'Sun, 24 Nov 2024 13:04:24 GMT', 'Content-Length': '190'})\nHTTP response body: {\"kind\":\"Status\",\"apiVersion\":\"v1\",\"metadata\":{},\"status\":\"Failure\",\"message\":\"pods \\\"example-pod\\\" not found\",\"reason\":\"NotFound\",\"details\":{\"name\":\"example-pod\",\"kind\":\"pods\"},\"code\":404}\n\n\nPod example-pod was running 0 out of 10 seconds.\n\n```\n\n- post-unittest-podrunningstatenginxpod\n```log\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/chaos-eater/sandbox/cycle_20241124_125841/hypothesis/unittest_PodRunningState_nginx_pod_mod0.py\", line 42, in <module>\n    test.test_pod_running_state()\n  File \"/chaos-eater/sandbox/cycle_20241124_125841/hypothesis/unittest_PodRunningState_nginx_pod_mod0.py\", line 33, in test_pod_running_state\nException when calling CoreV1Api->read_namespaced_pod: (404)\nReason: Not Found\nHTTP response headers: HTTPHeaderDict({'Audit-Id': '466fb70c-d71b-440f-8068-1562...'application/json', 'X-Kubernetes-Pf-Flowschema-Uid': 'c4624bd9-7fc7-42c6-bcb8-4235110a860d', 'X-Kubernetes-Pf-Prioritylevel-Uid': '4706085f-6263-43ae-93f5-b4a61de8b6be', 'Date': 'Sun, 24 Nov 2024 13:04:56 GMT', 'Content-Length': '190'})\nHTTP response body: {\"kind\":\"Status\",\"apiVersion\":\"v1\",\"metadata\":{},\"status\":\"Failure\",\"message\":\"pods \\\"example-pod\\\" not found\",\"reason\":\"NotFound\",\"details\":{\"name\":\"example-pod\",\"kind\":\"pods\"},\"code\":404}\n\n\nPod example-pod was running 0 out of 6 seconds.\n\n```\n\n- post-unittest-serviceroutingstatenginxservice\n```log\ntime=\"2024-11-24T13:04:55Z\" level=warning msg=\"Request Failed\" error=\"Get \\\"http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:80\\\": dial tcp 10.96.107.80:80: connect: connection refused\"\ntime=\"2024-11-24T13:04:55Z\" level=warning msg=\"Request Failed\" error=\"Get \\\"http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:80\\\": dial tcp 10.96.107.80:80: connect: connection refused\"\ntime=\"2024-11-24T13:04:55Z\" level=warning msg=\"Request Failed\" error=\"Get \\\"http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:8...    min=0s       med=0s    max=0s    p(90)=0s    p(95)=0s   \n     http_reqs..................: 13      1.812413/s\n     iteration_duration.........: avg=551.72ms min=211.05\u00b5s med=1.01s max=1.02s p(90)=1.02s p(95)=1.02s\n     iterations.................: 13      1.812413/s\n     vus........................: 1       min=1        max=1\n     vus_max....................: 1       min=1        max=1\n\ntime=\"2024-11-24T13:05:03Z\" level=error msg=\"thresholds on metrics 'http_req_failed' have been crossed\"\n\n```\n\n\nFirst, please analyze the results and provide an analysis report rich in insights.\nAI: # Here is my analysis report:\nThe Chaos Engineering experiment results indicate several critical failures in the system's ability to maintain its steady states under the simulated fault conditions. Here's a detailed analysis of the failures:\n\n1. **Failed Test: fault-unittest-podrunningstatenginxpod**\n   - **Observation**: The test failed because the Pod 'example-pod' was not found during the fault injection phase, resulting in a 404 error from the Kubernetes API.\n   - **Cause**: This failure is directly linked to the 'PodChaos' fault, which involved killing the Pod. Since the Pod's restart policy is set to 'Never', it did not automatically restart after being killed, leading to its unavailability.\n   - **Insight**: The 'restartPolicy: Never' configuration in the Pod manifest is a significant vulnerability. In a production environment, this would lead to downtime whenever the Pod fails, as there is no mechanism to bring it back online automatically.\n   - **Recommendation**: Change the Pod's restart policy to 'Always' or 'OnFailure' to ensure it restarts automatically after a failure, improving resilience against such disruptions.\n\n2. **Failed Test: post-unittest-podrunningstatenginxpod**\n   - **Observation**: Similar to the fault phase, the Pod was not found during the post-validation phase, resulting in a 404 error.\n   - **Cause**: The Pod did not recover after the 'PodChaos' fault due to the same restart policy issue. Since the Pod was not restarted, it remained unavailable throughout the post-validation phase.\n   - **Insight**: This further emphasizes the critical nature of the restart policy configuration. Without automatic recovery, the system cannot return to its steady state after a fault.\n   - **Recommendation**: Implement a replication strategy using a Deployment or ReplicaSet to ensure multiple instances of the Pod are running, providing redundancy and automatic recovery.\n\n3. **Failed Test: post-unittest-serviceroutingstatenginxservice**\n   - **Observation**: The Service failed to route traffic, resulting in connection refused errors during the post-validation phase.\n   - **Cause**: The failure of the Pod meant there were no available endpoints for the Service to route traffic to, leading to the connection errors.\n   - **Insight**: The single Pod deployment is a single point of failure. When the Pod is unavailable, the Service cannot function, highlighting the need for redundancy.\n   - **Recommendation**: Use a Deployment with multiple replicas to ensure that the Service always has available Pods to route traffic to, even if one or more Pods fail.\n\nOverall, the experiment highlights the critical need for redundancy and automatic recovery mechanisms in the system. Addressing the identified issues by adjusting the Pod's restart policy and implementing a Deployment with multiple replicas will significantly enhance the system's resilience against similar fault scenarios in the future.\nHuman: Then, please reconfigure the system to avoid the fails (improve resiliency).\nAI: ```json\n{\"thought\":"
