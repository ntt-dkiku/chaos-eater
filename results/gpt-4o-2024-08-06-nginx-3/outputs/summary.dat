The Chaos Engineering cycle described involves a systematic approach to testing the resilience of a Kubernetes-based system running an Nginx web server. The cycle begins with understanding the user inputs, which include Kubernetes manifests for a Pod and a Service. The Pod manifest specifies a single Nginx container with a restart policy of 'Never', while the Service manifest exposes this Pod on port 80. Two primary resiliency issues are identified: the Pod's restart policy and the single Pod deployment, both of which pose risks of downtime and single points of failure.

The hypothesis for the experiment is that the system's steady states will be maintained even when faults are injected. Two steady states are defined: the Pod should be running at least 90% of the time, and the Service should successfully route HTTP requests with a 95% success rate. These are tested using Python scripts and K6 JavaScript, respectively.

The fault scenario simulates a cyber attack using Chaos Mesh, introducing network delays and Pod failures to test the system's resilience. The experiment is divided into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation, each with specific tasks and time allocations to ensure the system's behavior is thoroughly assessed within a 1-minute timeframe.

In the first experiment attempt, several tests fail, particularly those related to the Pod's availability, due to the 'Never' restart policy and the single Pod deployment. The analysis highlights the need for redundancy and automatic recovery mechanisms, recommending changes to the Pod's restart policy and the use of a Deployment with multiple replicas.

After implementing these improvements, the second experiment attempt shows all tests passing, indicating that the system can maintain its steady states under fault conditions. The changes made include replacing the Pod manifest with a Deployment manifest, setting the restart policy to 'Always', and increasing the number of replicas to ensure redundancy and resilience.
