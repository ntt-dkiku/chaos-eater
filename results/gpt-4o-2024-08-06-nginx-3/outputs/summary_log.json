User-input understanding\n### Here is the overview of user inputs:\nThe system consists of the following K8s manifest(s):K8s manifest: nginx/pod.yaml\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: example-pod\n  labels:\n    app: example\nspec:\n  restartPolicy: Never\n  containers:\n  - name: example-container\n    image: nginx:1.17.1\n    ports:\n    - containerPort: 80\n```\nSummary of nginx/pod.yaml:\n- This manifest defines a Kubernetes Pod.\n- The Pod is named 'example-pod'.\n- It includes metadata with a label 'app: example'.\n- The Pod's restart policy is set to 'Never', meaning it won't restart automatically if it fails.\n- The Pod contains one container named 'example-container'.\n- The container uses the 'nginx:1.17.1' image.\n- The container exposes port 80 for network traffic.\n\nK8s manifest: nginx/service.yaml\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: example-service\nspec:\n  selector:\n    app: example\n  ports:\n    - protocol: TCP\n      port: 80\n      targetPort: 80\n```\nSummary of nginx/service.yaml:\n- This manifest defines a Kubernetes Service.\n- The Service is named 'example-service'.\n- It uses the 'v1' API version.\n- The Service selects pods with the label 'app: example'.\n- It exposes the Service on port 80 using the TCP protocol.\n- The target port for the Service is also port 80, meaning it forwards traffic to port 80 on the selected pods.\n\nThe resiliency issues/weaknesses in the system are as follows:\nIssue #0: Pod Restart Policy\n  - details: The Pod will not restart automatically if it fails, which can lead to downtime.\n  - manifests having the issues: ['nginx/pod.yaml']\n  - problematic config: restartPolicy: Never\n\nIssue #1: Single Pod Deployment\n  - details: Using a single Pod without replication can lead to a single point of failure.\n  - manifests having the issues: ['nginx/pod.yaml']\n  - problematic config: kind: Pod\n\nThe expected type of application on the system (i.e., K8s manfests):\nA simple web server application using Nginx to serve static web content or act as a reverse proxy.; The manifests provided are for a Kubernetes Pod and Service that utilize the Nginx web server. The Pod manifest specifies a container running the Nginx image, which is a popular open-source web server used for serving static content, reverse proxying, and load balancing. The Service manifest is configured to expose this Pod on port 80, which is the default port for HTTP traffic. Given the use of Nginx and the configuration of the Service, it is logical to assume that these manifests are intended to deploy a simple web server application. The file names and the use of Nginx further support this assumption.\n\nChaos-Engineering instructions for the system are as follows: - The Chaos-Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute.\n\n## Step 1. Hypothesis definition\n### Here is the overview of the hypothesis for the system:\nThe hypothesis is \"The steady states of the sytem are maintained even when the fault scenario occurs (i.e., when the faults are injected)\".\nThe steady states here are as follows:\n2 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: PodRunningState_nginx_pod\n- Description: The first issue to address is the Pod's restart policy set to 'Never', which means the Pod will not restart automatically if it fails. This is a critical issue because it can lead to downtime if the Pod encounters any failure. Therefore, the steady state should ensure that the Pod is running and available. A measurable output for this steady state is the number of running Pods. Since there is only one Pod defined in the manifest, the steady state should verify that this Pod is in the 'Running' state.\n- Threshold for the steady state: The Pod should be in the 'Running' state at least 90% of the time during the observation period.; The steady state we are considering is the 'PodRunningState_nginx_pod', which requires the Pod to be in the 'Running' state. The current state shows that the Pod was running 5 out of 5 seconds, which indicates a stable and consistent running state. To define a reasonable threshold, we should consider a percentage of time the Pod should be running within a given duration. Since the current state shows 100% uptime, we can introduce a small tolerance to account for potential brief fluctuations or delays in status updates. A reasonable threshold would be that the Pod should be running at least 90% of the time during the observation period. This allows for some minor fluctuations while still ensuring the Pod is generally stable and available.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestPodRunningState(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self, namespace, pod_name, duration):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.namespace = namespace\n        self.pod_name = pod_name\n        self.duration = duration\n\n    def test_pod_running_state(self):\n        running_count = 0\n\n        # Loop for the specified duration, checking the Pod's status every second\n        for _ in range(self.duration):\n            try:\n                pod = self.v1.read_namespaced_pod(name=self.pod_name, namespace=self.namespace)\n                if pod.status.phase == 'Running':\n                    running_count += 1\n                print(f\"Pod {self.pod_name} status: {pod.status.phase}\")\n            except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n                print(f\"Exception when calling CoreV1Api->read_namespaced_pod: {e}\")\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the percentage of time the Pod was running\n        running_percentage = (running_count / self.duration) * 100\n        print(f\"Pod {self.pod_name} was running {running_count} out of {self.duration} seconds.\")\n\n        # Assert that the Pod was running at least 90% of the time\n        assert running_percentage >= 90, f\"Pod {self.pod_name} was not running at least 90% of the time. Running percentage: {running_percentage}%\"\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test the running status of a Kubernetes Pod.')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=5, help='Duration to check the Pod status in seconds')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    # Create an instance of the test class and run the test\n    test = TestPodRunningState(namespace='default', pod_name='example-pod', duration=args.duration)\n    test.test_pod_running_state()\n\n```2nd steady states:\n- Name: ServiceRoutingState_nginx_service\n- Description: The next issue to address is the 'Single Pod Deployment', which can lead to a single point of failure. This is a critical issue because if the single Pod fails, the entire service becomes unavailable. To ensure the system's resiliency, we need to verify that the Service is able to route traffic to the Pod. A measurable output for this steady state is the Service's ability to successfully forward requests to the Pod. Since the Service is configured to expose the Pod on port 80, the steady state should verify that the Service is able to handle HTTP requests and return a successful response (e.g., HTTP 200 status code). This will ensure that the Service is functioning correctly and can route traffic to the Pod, even if there is only one Pod available.\n- Threshold for the steady state: HTTP 200 response success rate >= 95%; The steady state we are evaluating is the Service's ability to route traffic to the Pod and return a successful HTTP response. The k6 test results show that 100% of the requests received a 200 status code, indicating that the Service is currently functioning correctly. To define a reasonable threshold, we should consider a success rate that accounts for minor fluctuations while still ensuring the system is operating normally. Given the current success rate is 100%, a threshold of 95% success rate for HTTP 200 responses would be reasonable. This allows for some tolerance in case of transient issues, while still maintaining a high standard for system availability.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following K6 Javascript:\n```\nimport http from 'k6/http';\nimport { check } from 'k6';\n\nexport const options = {\n  vus: 1,\n  duration: '5s',\n  thresholds: {\n    // Ensure that the success rate for HTTP 200 responses is at least 95%\n    'http_req_failed': ['rate<0.05'],\n  },\n};\n\nexport default function () {\n  const res = http.get('http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:80');\n  check(res, {\n    'is status 200': (r) => r.status === 200,\n  });\n}\n```\n\nThe fault scenario here is as follows:\n\nAn assumed fault scenario is as follows:\n- Event: Cyber Attack Simulation\n- Used Chaos Engineering tool: Chaos Mesh\n- Faults to simulate the event: [[Fault(name='NetworkChaos', name_id=0, params={'action': 'delay', 'direction': 'to', 'mode': 'all', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}, 'delay': {'latency': '100ms', 'jitter': '10ms'}})], [Fault(name='PodChaos', name_id=0, params={'action': 'pod-kill', 'mode': 'one', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}})]]\n- Description: Given the system's weaknesses, a cyber attack targeting the availability of the web server could be highly impactful. The Pod's restart policy set to 'Never' and the single Pod deployment create vulnerabilities that could lead to downtime if the Pod fails. To simulate a cyber attack, we can introduce network disruptions and resource exhaustion to test the system's resilience. First, we will simulate network latency to see if the Service can still route traffic effectively, which tests the 'ServiceRoutingState_nginx_service'. Then, we will introduce a Pod failure to test the 'PodRunningState_nginx_pod', checking if the system can recover from a Pod failure without automatic restarts. This sequence simulates a cyber attack by first degrading network performance and then causing a Pod failure, testing the system's ability to maintain its steady states under stress.\n\n## Step 2.1. Chaos-Engineering experiment\n### Here is the overview of my Chaos-Engineering experiment to verify the hypothesis:\nThe entire time schedule of the Chaos-Engineering experiment is as follows (The experiment is divided into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation phases):\nGiven the constraints of the experiment needing to be completed within 1 minute, we need to allocate time efficiently across the three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation. The pre-validation phase is crucial to ensure that the system is in its expected steady state before introducing any faults. Since we have two steady states to validate, we should allocate a short but sufficient time to verify both the Pod's running state and the Service's routing capability. A reasonable allocation would be 15 seconds for pre-validation. The fault-injection phase is where we introduce the chaos to observe the system's behavior under stress. Since we have two types of faults to inject (network delay and pod kill), we should allocate the majority of the time here to observe the system's response. A 30-second duration for fault injection allows us to introduce both faults and monitor their effects. Finally, the post-validation phase is necessary to ensure that the system returns to its steady states after the faults are removed. We should allocate 15 seconds for post-validation to verify that both the Pod and Service have returned to their expected states. This allocation ensures that we have a balanced approach to validating the system's resiliency within the 1-minute constraint.\n- Total experiment phase: 1m\n- Pre-validation phase: 15s\n- Fault-injection phase: 30s\n- Post-validation phase: 15s\n\nThe details of the three phases are as follows:\nPre-validation Phase (15s):\nIn the pre-validation phase, we need to ensure that the system is in its expected steady states before we proceed with fault injection. Given the two steady states defined, we will conduct unit tests to verify each of them. The tests will be executed sequentially within the 15-second time frame allocated for this phase. The first test will verify the 'PodRunningState_nginx_pod', ensuring that the Pod is running at least 90% of the time. This test will be conducted first because it directly checks the availability of the Pod, which is critical for the subsequent service routing test. The second test will verify the 'ServiceRoutingState_nginx_service', ensuring that the Service can successfully route HTTP requests with a 95% success rate for HTTP 200 responses. This test will follow immediately after the first test. The sequential execution ensures that we first confirm the Pod's availability before checking the Service's routing capability, as the latter depends on the former. Each test is designed to run for a short duration to fit within the 15-second limit, with a brief grace period to allow for any initial setup or delays.\n\nFault-injection Phase (30s):\nIn this fault-injection phase, we aim to simulate a cyber attack by introducing two types of faults: network latency and pod failure. The total duration for this phase is 30 seconds, so we need to carefully schedule the fault injections and unit tests to fit within this timeframe. \n\nFirst, we will introduce a network delay using NetworkChaos to simulate network latency. This will help us observe how the system handles degraded network performance and affects the 'ServiceRoutingState_nginx_service'. We will start this fault injection immediately at the beginning of the phase and let it run for 15 seconds. \n\nSimultaneously, we will run the unit test for 'ServiceRoutingState_nginx_service' to verify if the service can still route traffic effectively under network delay conditions. This test will also start at the beginning and run for 15 seconds.\n\nAfter the network delay fault injection and the corresponding unit test, we will introduce a pod failure using PodChaos. This will help us observe the system's behavior when the pod is killed, affecting the 'PodRunningState_nginx_pod'. We will start this fault injection at the 15-second mark and let it run for 10 seconds.\n\nSimultaneously, we will run the unit test for 'PodRunningState_nginx_pod' to verify if the pod remains in the running state at least 90% of the time during the observation period. This test will start at the 15-second mark and run for 10 seconds.\n\nThis staggered approach allows us to observe the system's behavior under each fault condition separately while ensuring that both steady states are tested within the 30-second limit.\n\nPost-validation Phase (15s):\nIn the post-validation phase, we need to ensure that the system has returned to its steady states after the fault injection. Given the 15-second time constraint, we will conduct unit tests to verify each steady state. The tests will be executed sequentially due to the short duration, ensuring that each steady state is verified independently. The first test will check the 'PodRunningState_nginx_pod' to confirm that the Pod is running and available. The second test will verify the 'ServiceRoutingState_nginx_service' to ensure that the Service can successfully route traffic to the Pod. Each test will have a brief grace period to allow the system to stabilize after the fault injection, followed by a short duration to perform the verification. This approach ensures that both steady states are validated within the available time, confirming the system's recovery.\n\nThe summary of the above experiment plan:\nThe Chaos-Engineering-experiment plan is structured into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation, all to be completed within a 1-minute timeframe. \n\nIn the pre-validation phase, which lasts for 15 seconds, two unit tests are executed sequentially. The first test, 'PodRunningState_nginx_pod', is conducted with a workflow named 'pre-unittest-podrunningstatenginxpod'. It starts immediately with no delay and runs for 7 seconds to ensure the Pod is running at least 90% of the time. Following this, the second test, 'ServiceRoutingState_nginx_service', is executed with the workflow 'pre-unittest-serviceroutingstatenginxservice'. It begins after a 7-second grace period and runs for 8 seconds to verify that the Service can route HTTP requests with a 95% success rate for HTTP 200 responses.\n\nThe fault-injection phase spans 30 seconds and involves two simultaneous fault injections and unit tests. At the start of this phase, a network delay is introduced using 'NetworkChaos' with the workflow 'fault-networkchaos', running for 15 seconds. Concurrently, the 'ServiceRoutingState_nginx_service' unit test is executed with the workflow 'fault-unittest-serviceroutingstatenginxservice', also for 15 seconds, to assess the service's routing capability under network delay conditions. At the 15-second mark, a pod failure is introduced using 'PodChaos' with the workflow 'fault-podchaos', running for 10 seconds. Simultaneously, the 'PodRunningState_nginx_pod' unit test is conducted with the workflow 'fault-unittest-podrunningstatenginxpod', also for 10 seconds, to verify the pod's availability during the fault.\n\nIn the post-validation phase, lasting 15 seconds, two unit tests are executed sequentially to confirm the system's recovery. The first test, 'PodRunningState_nginx_pod', is conducted with the workflow 'post-unittest-podrunningstatenginxpod'. It starts after a 2-second grace period and runs for 6 seconds to ensure the Pod is running and available. The second test, 'ServiceRoutingState_nginx_service', follows with the workflow 'post-unittest-serviceroutingstatenginxservice'. It begins after an 8-second grace period and runs for 7 seconds to verify the Service's ability to route traffic to the Pod. This structured approach ensures a comprehensive assessment of the system's resilience and recovery within the 1-minute constraint.\n\nTo automatically conduct the above experiment plan with Chaos Mesh, the following Chaos-Mesh-Worfklow file was created (by applying it to the cluster, the experiment plan will be automatically executed according to the Chaos-Mesh-Worfklow file):\n```yaml\napiVersion: chaos-mesh.org/v1alpha1\nkind: Workflow\nmetadata:\n  name: chaos-experiment-20241124-130832\nspec:\n  entry: the-entry\n  templates:\n    #-------------------------------\n    # entry point of whole workflow\n    #-------------------------------\n    -

Here's a detailed analysis of the failures:\n\n1. **Failed Test: fault-unittest-podrunningstatenginxpod**\n   - **Observation**: The test failed because the Pod 'example-pod' was not found during the fault injection phase, resulting in a 404 error from the Kubernetes API.\n   - **Cause**: This failure is directly linked to the 'PodChaos' fault, which involved killing the Pod. Since the Pod's restart policy is set to 'Never', it did not automatically restart after being killed, leading to its unavailability.\n   - **Insight**: The 'restartPolicy: Never' configuration in the Pod manifest is a significant vulnerability. In a production environment, this would lead to downtime whenever the Pod fails, as there is no mechanism to bring it back online automatically.\n   - **Recommendation**: Change the Pod's restart policy to 'Always' or 'OnFailure' to ensure it restarts automatically after a failure, improving resilience against such disruptions.\n\n2. **Failed Test: post-unittest-podrunningstatenginxpod**\n   - **Observation**: Similar to the fault phase, the Pod was not found during the post-validation phase, resulting in a 404 error.\n   - **Cause**: The Pod did not recover after the 'PodChaos' fault due to the same restart policy issue. Since the Pod was not restarted, it remained unavailable throughout the post-validation phase.\n   - **Insight**: This further emphasizes the critical nature of the restart policy configuration. Without automatic recovery, the system cannot return to its steady state after a fault.\n   - **Recommendation**: Implement a replication strategy using a Deployment or ReplicaSet to ensure multiple instances of the Pod are running, providing redundancy and automatic recovery.\n\n3. **Failed Test: post-unittest-serviceroutingstatenginxservice**\n   - **Observation**: The Service failed to route traffic, resulting in connection refused errors during the post-validation phase.\n   - **Cause**: The failure of the Pod meant there were no available endpoints for the Service to route traffic to, leading to the connection errors.\n   - **Insight**: The single Pod deployment is a single point of failure. When the Pod is unavailable, the Service cannot function, highlighting the need for redundancy.\n   - **Recommendation**: Use a Deployment with multiple replicas to ensure that the Service always has available Pods to route traffic to, even if one or more Pods fail.\n\nOverall, the experiment highlights the critical need for redundancy and automatic recovery mechanisms in the system. Addressing the identified issues by adjusting the Pod's restart policy and implementing a Deployment with multiple replicas will significantly enhance the system's resilience against similar fault scenarios in the future.\n\n### Improvement result (1st try)\n1 K8s manifests are modified:\n- The K8s manifest 'nginx/pod.yaml' was replaced.\nReplace the Pod manifest with a Deployment manifest to provide redundancy and automatic recovery. Set the restart policy to 'Always' to ensure Pods are restarted automatically if they fail.\n```yaml\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: example-deployment\n  labels:\n    app: example\nspec:\n  replicas: 3\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: example\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: example\n    spec:\n      restartPolicy: Always\n      containers:\n      - name: example-container\n        image: nginx:1.17.1\n        ports:\n        - containerPort: 80\n```\n\n\n\n### Experiment result (2nd try)\nPassed unittests:\n- pre-unittest-podrunningstatenginxpod\n- pre-unittest-serviceroutingstatenginxservice\n- fault-unittest-serviceroutingstatenginxservice\n- fault-unittest-podrunningstatenginxpod\n- post-unittest-podrunningstatenginxpod\n- post-unittest-serviceroutingstatenginxservice\nFailed unittests:\n\n\nPlease elaborate the above summary of a Chaos Engineering Cycle.\nAI: ```json\n{\"summary\":"
            ],
            "{\"summary\":\"The Chaos Engineering cycle described involves a systematic approach to testing the resilience of a Kubernetes-based system running an Nginx web server. The cycle begins with understanding the user inputs, which include Kubernetes manifests for a Pod and a Service. The Pod manifest specifies a single Nginx container with a restart policy of 'Never', while the Service manifest exposes this Pod on port 80. Two primary resiliency issues are identified: the Pod's restart policy and the single Pod deployment, both of which pose risks of downtime and single points of failure.\\n\\nThe hypothesis for the experiment is that the system's steady states will be maintained even when faults are injected. Two steady states are defined: the Pod should be running at least 90% of the time, and the Service should successfully route HTTP requests with a 95% success rate. These are tested using Python scripts and K6 JavaScript, respectively.\\n\\nThe fault scenario simulates a cyber attack using Chaos Mesh, introducing network delays and Pod failures to test the system's resilience. The experiment is divided into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation, each with specific tasks and time allocations to ensure the system's behavior is thoroughly assessed within a 1-minute timeframe.\\n\\nIn the first experiment attempt, several tests fail, particularly those related to the Pod's availability, due to the 'Never' restart policy and the single Pod deployment. The analysis highlights the need for redundancy and automatic recovery mechanisms, recommending changes to the Pod's restart policy and the use of a Deployment with multiple replicas.\\n\\nAfter implementing these improvements, the second experiment attempt shows all tests passing, indicating that the system can maintain its steady states under fault conditions. The changes made include replacing the Pod manifest with a Deployment manifest, setting the restart policy to 'Always', and increasing the number of replicas to ensure redundancy and resilience.\"}"
