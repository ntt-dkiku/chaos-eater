The Chaos Engineering cycle described involves a systematic approach to testing the resilience of a Kubernetes-based system running an Nginx web server. The cycle begins with understanding the user inputs, which include Kubernetes manifests for a Pod and a Service. The Pod manifest specifies a single Nginx container with a restart policy of 'Never', while the Service manifest exposes this Pod on port 80. Two main resiliency issues are identified: the Pod's restart policy and the lack of redundancy due to a single Pod deployment.

The hypothesis for the experiment is that the system should maintain its steady states even when faults are injected. Two steady states are defined: the Pod should be running at least 90% of the time, and the Service should have an HTTP response rate of at least 99.5% with status code 200. These are tested using Python scripts and K6 JavaScript, respectively.

The fault scenario simulates a cyber attack using Chaos Mesh, injecting PodChaos to kill the Pod and NetworkChaos to partition the network. The experiment is divided into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation, all within a 1-minute timeframe. Pre-validation ensures the system is in a steady state, fault-injection tests the system's resilience under attack, and post-validation checks if the system returns to its steady state.

The first experiment attempt fails during the fault-injection and post-validation phases, as the Pod does not restart due to its 'Never' restart policy, and the Service cannot connect to the Pod. The analysis suggests changing the Pod's restart policy and deploying it using a Deployment for redundancy.

After modifying the Pod manifest to a Deployment with three replicas and a restart policy of 'Always', the second experiment attempt passes all unit tests, confirming the system's improved resilience. This cycle demonstrates the importance of redundancy and automatic recovery in maintaining system stability under fault conditions.
