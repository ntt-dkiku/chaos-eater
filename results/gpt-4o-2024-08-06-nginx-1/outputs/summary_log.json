User-input understanding\n### Here is the overview of user inputs:\nThe system consists of the following K8s manifest(s):K8s manifest: nginx/pod.yaml\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: example-pod\n  labels:\n    app: example\nspec:\n  restartPolicy: Never\n  containers:\n  - name: example-container\n    image: nginx:1.17.1\n    ports:\n    - containerPort: 80\n```\nSummary of nginx/pod.yaml:\n- This manifest defines a Kubernetes Pod.\n- The Pod is named 'example-pod'.\n- It includes metadata with a label 'app: example'.\n- The Pod's restart policy is set to 'Never', meaning it won't restart automatically if it fails.\n- The Pod contains a single container named 'example-container'.\n- The container uses the 'nginx:1.17.1' image.\n- The container exposes port 80, which is typically used for HTTP traffic.\n\nK8s manifest: nginx/service.yaml\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: example-service\nspec:\n  selector:\n    app: example\n  ports:\n    - protocol: TCP\n      port: 80\n      targetPort: 80\n```\nSummary of nginx/service.yaml:\n- This manifest defines a Kubernetes Service.\n- The Service is named 'example-service'.\n- It uses a selector to target pods with the label 'app: example'.\n- The Service listens on port 80 using the TCP protocol.\n- It forwards traffic to the target port 80 on the selected pods.\n\nThe resiliency issues/weaknesses in the system are as follows:\nIssue #0: Pod Restart Policy\n  - details: The Pod will not restart automatically if it fails, which can lead to downtime.\n  - manifests having the issues: ['nginx/pod.yaml']\n  - problematic config: restartPolicy: Never\n\nIssue #1: Single Pod Deployment\n  - details: Using a single Pod without a controller like Deployment or ReplicaSet can lead to lack of redundancy and no automatic recovery if the Pod is deleted or fails.\n  - manifests having the issues: ['nginx/pod.yaml']\n  - problematic config: kind: Pod\n\nThe expected type of application on the system (i.e., K8s manfests):\nWeb server hosting a static website using Nginx.; The manifests provided are for a Pod and a Service in Kubernetes, both of which are associated with the label 'app: example'. The Pod runs an Nginx container, which is a popular web server and reverse proxy server. The Service is configured to expose the Pod on port 80, which is the default port for HTTP traffic. Given these details, it is logical to assume that the application is a simple web server or a static website hosted using Nginx. The use of Nginx and the exposure of port 80 strongly suggest that the application is intended to serve web content.\n\nChaos-Engineering instructions for the system are as follows: - The Chaos-Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute.\n\n## Step 1. Hypothesis definition\n### Here is the overview of the hypothesis for the system:\nThe hypothesis is \"The steady states of the sytem are maintained even when the fault scenario occurs (i.e., when the faults are injected)\".\nThe steady states here are as follows:\n2 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: PodRunningStatusNginxPodYaml\n- Description: The first issue to address is the Pod's restart policy set to 'Never'. This is a critical issue because if the Pod fails, it will not restart automatically, leading to potential downtime. Therefore, the steady state should verify that the Pod is running and not in a failed state. This can be measured by checking the Pod's status to ensure it is 'Running'. This steady state is specific to the 'nginx/pod.yaml' manifest, which defines the Pod with the problematic restart policy.\n- Threshold for the steady state: The Pod should be in the 'Running' state for at least 90% of the time during the observation period.; The steady state we are considering is the Pod's running status. The current state shows that the Pod was running for 5 out of 5 seconds, which is 100% of the time. Given that the Pod's restart policy is set to 'Never', it is crucial to ensure that the Pod remains in the 'Running' state to avoid downtime. However, to account for minor fluctuations or delays in status updates, a reasonable threshold would be to expect the Pod to be in the 'Running' state for at least 90% of the time during the observation period. This allows for some tolerance while still ensuring that the Pod is generally stable and operational.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestPodRunningStatus(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self, namespace, pod_name, duration):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.namespace = namespace\n        self.pod_name = pod_name\n        self.duration = duration\n\n    def test_pod_running_status(self):\n        running_count = 0\n        # Loop for the specified duration\n        for _ in range(self.duration):\n            try:\n                # Read the Pod status\n                pod = self.v1.read_namespaced_pod(name=self.pod_name, namespace=self.namespace)\n                # Check if the Pod is in 'Running' state\n                if pod.status.phase == 'Running':\n                    running_count += 1\n                print(f\"Pod status: {pod.status.phase}\")\n            except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n                print(f\"Exception when calling CoreV1Api->read_namespaced_pod: {e}\")\n            time.sleep(1)\n        # Calculate the percentage of time the Pod was running\n        running_percentage = (running_count / self.duration) * 100\n        print(f\"Pod was running {running_count} out of {self.duration} seconds, which is {running_percentage}% of the time.\")\n        # Assert that the Pod was running at least 90% of the time\n        assert running_percentage >= 90, \"Pod did not meet the 90% running threshold.\"\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test the running status of a Kubernetes Pod.')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=5, help='Duration to check the Pod status in seconds.')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n    # Create an instance of the test class\n    test = TestPodRunningStatus(namespace='default', pod_name='example-pod', duration=args.duration)\n    # Run the test\n    test.test_pod_running_status()\n```2nd steady states:\n- Name: ServiceAvailabilityNginxServiceYaml\n- Description: The next issue to address is the lack of redundancy due to the use of a single Pod without a controller like Deployment or ReplicaSet. This can lead to a lack of automatic recovery if the Pod is deleted or fails. To verify the system's resilience, we should define a steady state that measures the availability of the web service provided by the Pod. Since the Service is responsible for exposing the Pod, we can measure the HTTP response rate or availability of the service. This steady state will ensure that the Service is consistently able to route traffic to the Pod, even if the Pod encounters issues. This is specific to the 'nginx/service.yaml' manifest, which defines the Service that selects the Pod.\n- Threshold for the steady state: HTTP response rate should be >= 99.5% with status code 200.; The steady state we are considering is the availability of the web service provided by the Nginx Pod, as measured by the HTTP response rate. The k6 test results show that 100% of the requests received a 200 status code, indicating that the service is fully available. To account for potential fluctuations and ensure the threshold is reasonable, we should allow for a small margin of error. A typical approach is to set the threshold slightly below 100% to accommodate minor network issues or transient errors that might occur in a real-world scenario. Given the current state shows perfect availability, a threshold of 99.5% would be reasonable, allowing for some tolerance while still ensuring high availability.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following K6 Javascript:\n```\nimport http from 'k6/http';\nimport { check } from 'k6';\n\nexport let options = {\n  vus: 10,\n  duration: '5s',\n  thresholds: {\n    'http_req_failed': ['rate<0.005'], // Allowing for a 0.5% failure rate\n    'http_req_duration': ['p(95)<200'], // Optional: 95% of requests should be below 200ms\n  },\n};\n\nexport default function () {\n  let res = http.get('http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:80');\n  check(res, {\n    'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,\n  });\n}\n```\n\nThe fault scenario here is as follows:\n\nAn assumed fault scenario is as follows:\n- Event: Cyber Attack\n- Used Chaos Engineering tool: Chaos Mesh\n- Faults to simulate the event: [[Fault(name='PodChaos', name_id=0, params={'action': 'pod-kill', 'mode': 'one', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}})], [Fault(name='NetworkChaos', name_id=1, params={'action': 'partition', 'mode': 'one', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}, 'direction': 'both'})]]\n- Description: In a cyber attack scenario, the attacker might target the single point of failure in the system, which is the single Pod running the Nginx server. The Pod's restart policy is set to 'Never', meaning if it fails, it won't restart automatically, leading to downtime. Additionally, the lack of redundancy due to the single Pod deployment without a controller like Deployment or ReplicaSet makes the system vulnerable to attacks that can take down the Pod. To simulate this, we can inject a PodChaos fault to kill the Pod, testing the system's ability to maintain the steady state of service availability. This will directly test the system's weakness in handling Pod failures and its impact on the steady state of service availability. Following this, we can simulate a network partition using NetworkChaos to test if the service can still route traffic effectively, even if the Pod is isolated from the network. This sequence simulates a cyber attack where the attacker first takes down the Pod and then attempts to disrupt network communication.\n\n## Step 2.1. Chaos-Engineering experiment\n### Here is the overview of my Chaos-Engineering experiment to verify the hypothesis:\nThe entire time schedule of the Chaos-Engineering experiment is as follows (The experiment is divided into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation phases):\nGiven the constraints and the nature of the system, we need to design a Chaos Engineering experiment that fits within a 1-minute timeframe. The experiment will be divided into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation. \n\n1. **Pre-validation Phase**: This phase ensures that the system is in a steady state before we introduce any faults. We need to verify that the Pod is running and the service is available. Since the steady state checks are relatively quick (5 seconds for Pod status and 5 seconds for service availability), we can allocate 10 seconds for this phase.\n\n2. **Fault Injection Phase**: This is the core of the experiment where we introduce faults to observe the system's behavior. We have two faults to inject: PodChaos to kill the Pod and NetworkChaos to partition the network. Given the time constraint, we will inject these faults sequentially but quickly. We can allocate 30 seconds for this phase, allowing 15 seconds for each fault to take effect and observe the immediate impact.\n\n3. **Post-validation Phase**: After the faults are removed, we need to ensure that the system returns to its steady state. Similar to the pre-validation phase, we will check the Pod's running status and the service's availability. We can allocate 20 seconds for this phase to ensure the system stabilizes and meets the steady state thresholds.\n\nThe total time for the experiment is 60 seconds, which is within the 1-minute limit. This allocation allows us to thoroughly test the system's resilience while adhering to the time constraint.\n- Total experiment phase: 60s\n- Pre-validation phase: 10s\n- Fault-injection phase: 30s\n- Post-validation phase: 20s\n\nThe details of the three phases are as follows:\nPre-validation Phase (10s):\nIn the pre-validation phase, we need to ensure that the system is in its expected steady state before we proceed with fault injection. Given the constraints, we have 10 seconds to perform these checks. We have two steady states to verify: the Pod's running status and the Service's availability. Since both checks are critical to ensure the system's readiness, they will be executed simultaneously to maximize the use of the available time. The Pod's running status will be checked continuously for 5 seconds, while the Service's availability will be tested using a k6 script for the same duration. This approach ensures that both steady states are verified within the 10-second window, allowing us to confidently proceed to the fault injection phase.\n\nFault-injection Phase (30s):\nIn this fault-injection phase, we aim to simulate a cyber attack scenario by injecting two types of faults: PodChaos and NetworkChaos. The total duration for this phase is 30 seconds, so we need to carefully schedule the fault injections and unit tests to fit within this timeframe. \n\nFirst, we will inject the PodChaos fault to simulate a pod failure. This will test the system's ability to maintain the steady state of service availability when the pod is killed. We will start this fault injection immediately at the beginning of the phase (grace period of 0s) and let it run for 10 seconds. \n\nSimultaneously, we will run the unit test for the first steady state, 'PodRunningStatusNginxPodYaml', to verify if the pod remains in the 'Running' state for at least 90% of the time. This test will also start at 0s and run for 10 seconds, aligning with the PodChaos fault duration.\n\nNext, we will inject the NetworkChaos fault to simulate a network partition. This will test the system's ability to maintain service availability despite network disruptions. We will start this fault injection at 10 seconds (grace period of 10s) and let it run for another 10 seconds.\n\nDuring the NetworkChaos fault, we will run the unit test for the second steady state, 'ServiceAvailabilityNginxServiceYaml', to verify if the HTTP response rate remains at or above 99.5%. This test will start at 10 seconds and run for 10 seconds, aligning with the NetworkChaos fault duration.\n\nBy staggering the fault injections and aligning them with the unit tests, we can effectively observe the system's behavior under each fault condition and ensure that the steady states are verified during the fault-injection phase.\n\nPost-validation Phase (20s):\nIn the post-validation phase, we need to ensure that the system has returned to its steady states after the fault injection. Given the constraints of a 20-second total time for this phase, we will conduct unit tests to verify each steady state. The tests will be executed sequentially due to the short time frame, ensuring that each steady state is verified independently. The first test will check the Pod's running status, as this is critical to ensure that the Pod has recovered from the PodChaos fault. The second test will verify the service availability, ensuring that the network partition did not cause lasting disruption. Each test will have a short grace period to allow the system to stabilize after the fault injection, followed by a brief duration to perform the checks. This approach ensures that we can quickly verify the system's recovery while adhering to the time constraints.\n\nThe summary of the above experiment plan:\nThe Chaos Engineering experiment is structured into three phases within a 1-minute timeframe: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation. \n\nIn the pre-validation phase, which lasts for 10 seconds, two unit tests are executed simultaneously to ensure the system is in a steady state. The first test, 'PodRunningStatusNginxPodYaml', checks the Pod's running status with a workflow named 'pre-unittest-podrunningstatusnginxpodyaml'. It starts immediately and runs for 5 seconds. Concurrently, the second test, 'ServiceAvailabilityNginxServiceYaml', verifies the service's availability using a k6 script, with a workflow named 'pre-unittest-serviceavailabilitynginxserviceyaml'. This test also starts immediately and runs for 5 seconds.\n\nThe fault-injection phase spans 30 seconds and involves two sequential fault injections. Initially, the 'PodChaos' fault is injected to simulate a pod failure, starting at the beginning of the phase and lasting for 10 seconds. This is managed by the 'fault-podchaos' workflow. Simultaneously, the unit test 'PodRunningStatusNginxPodYaml' is conducted to verify the pod's running status, starting at 0 seconds and running for 10 seconds, with the workflow 'fault-unittest-podrunningstatusnginxpodyaml'. Following this, the 'NetworkChaos' fault is injected to simulate a network partition, starting at 10 seconds and lasting for 10 seconds, managed by the 'fault-networkchaos' workflow. Concurrently, the unit test 'ServiceAvailabilityNginxServiceYaml' is executed to verify service availability, starting at 10 seconds and running for 10 seconds, with the workflow 'fault-unittest-serviceavailabilitynginxserviceyaml'.\n\nIn the post-validation phase, which lasts for 20 seconds, two unit tests are executed sequentially to ensure the system has returned to its steady state. The first test, 'PodRunningStatusNginxPodYaml', checks the Pod's running status, starting after a 2-second grace period and running for 8 seconds, with the workflow 'post-unittest-podrunningstatusnginxpodyaml'. The second test, 'ServiceAvailabilityNginxServiceYaml', verifies service availability, also starting after a 2-second grace period and running for 8 seconds, with the workflow 'post-unittest-serviceavailabilitynginxserviceyaml'. This sequential execution ensures each steady state is independently verified within the 20-second timeframe.\n\nTo automatically conduct the above experiment plan with Chaos Mesh, the following Chaos-Mesh-Worfklow file was created (by applying it to the cluster, the experiment plan will be automatically executed according to the Chaos-Mesh-Worfklow file):\n```yaml\napiVersion: chaos-mesh.org/v1alpha1\nkind: Workflow\nmetadata:\n  name: chaos-experiment-20241124-124141\nspec:\n  entry: the-entry\n  templates:\n    #-------------------------------\n    # entry point of whole workflow\n    #-------------------------------\n    -

Let's analyze the reasons for these failures step by step:\n\n1. **Pre-Validation Phase Success**: Both pre-validation tests passed, indicating that the system was initially in a steady state. The Pod was running, and the service was available, confirming that the system was correctly set up before the fault injection.\n\n2. **Fault Injection Phase Failures**:\n   - **PodChaos Fault**: The 'PodChaos' fault was injected to kill the Pod. The test 'fault-unittest-podrunningstatusnginxpodyaml' failed because the Pod was not found (HTTP 404 error). This is expected behavior given the Pod's restart policy is set to 'Never', meaning it does not automatically restart after being killed. This confirms the identified resiliency issue #0 (Pod Restart Policy) and issue #1 (Single Pod Deployment) in the system configuration.\n   - **NetworkChaos Fault**: The 'NetworkChaos' fault was injected to simulate a network partition. The test 'fault-unittest-serviceavailabilitynginxserviceyaml' failed because the service was unable to connect to the Pod (connection refused errors). This failure is a direct consequence of the Pod being unavailable due to the PodChaos fault, highlighting the lack of redundancy and automatic recovery mechanisms in the system.\n\n3. **Post-Validation Phase Failures**:\n   - **Pod Running Status**: The 'post-unittest-podrunningstatusnginxpodyaml' test failed because the Pod was still not found. This indicates that the system did not recover from the PodChaos fault, as expected due to the 'Never' restart policy.\n   - **Service Availability**: The 'post-unittest-serviceavailabilitynginxserviceyaml' test also failed, with continued connection refused errors. This further confirms that the service could not route traffic because the Pod was not running, emphasizing the impact of the single Pod deployment without redundancy.\n\n**Insights and Recommendations**:\n- **Pod Restart Policy**: Change the Pod's restart policy from 'Never' to 'Always' or 'OnFailure' to ensure automatic recovery in case of failures.\n- **Redundancy and Scalability**: Deploy the Pod using a Deployment or ReplicaSet to manage multiple replicas, providing redundancy and automatic recovery. This will mitigate the single point of failure issue and improve the system's resilience against Pod failures.\n- **Service Resilience**: Ensure that the Service can handle Pod failures by having multiple Pods behind it. This can be achieved by scaling the Deployment to have more replicas.\n\nBy addressing these issues, the system will be better equipped to maintain its steady states even when faults are injected, thus improving its overall resilience.\n\n### Improvement result (1st try)\n1 K8s manifests are modified:\n- The K8s manifest 'nginx/pod.yaml' was replaced.\nReplace the Pod manifest with a Deployment manifest to provide redundancy and automatic recovery. The Deployment will manage multiple replicas of the Pod, ensuring that the application remains available even if one Pod fails. The restart policy is set to 'Always' to ensure Pods are restarted automatically if they fail.\n```yaml\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: example-deployment\n  labels:\n    app: example\nspec:\n  replicas: 3\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: example\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: example\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: example-container\n        image: nginx:1.17.1\n        ports:\n        - containerPort: 80\n      restartPolicy: Always\n```\n\n\n\n### Experiment result (2nd try)\nPassed unittests:\n- pre-unittest-podrunningstatusnginxpodyaml\n- pre-unittest-serviceavailabilitynginxserviceyaml\n- fault-unittest-podrunningstatusnginxpodyaml\n- fault-unittest-serviceavailabilitynginxserviceyaml\n- post-unittest-podrunningstatusnginxpodyaml\n- post-unittest-serviceavailabilitynginxserviceyaml\nFailed unittests:\n\n\nPlease elaborate the above summary of a Chaos Engineering Cycle.\nAI: ```json\n{\"summary\":"
            ],
            "{\"summary\":\"The Chaos Engineering cycle described involves a systematic approach to testing the resilience of a Kubernetes-based system running an Nginx web server. The cycle begins with understanding the user inputs, which include Kubernetes manifests for a Pod and a Service. The Pod manifest specifies a single Nginx container with a restart policy of 'Never', while the Service manifest exposes this Pod on port 80. Two main resiliency issues are identified: the Pod's restart policy and the lack of redundancy due to a single Pod deployment.\\n\\nThe hypothesis for the experiment is that the system should maintain its steady states even when faults are injected. Two steady states are defined: the Pod should be running at least 90% of the time, and the Service should have an HTTP response rate of at least 99.5% with status code 200. These are tested using Python scripts and K6 JavaScript, respectively.\\n\\nThe fault scenario simulates a cyber attack using Chaos Mesh, injecting PodChaos to kill the Pod and NetworkChaos to partition the network. The experiment is divided into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation, all within a 1-minute timeframe. Pre-validation ensures the system is in a steady state, fault-injection tests the system's resilience under attack, and post-validation checks if the system returns to its steady state.\\n\\nThe first experiment attempt fails during the fault-injection and post-validation phases, as the Pod does not restart due to its 'Never' restart policy, and the Service cannot connect to the Pod. The analysis suggests changing the Pod's restart policy and deploying it using a Deployment for redundancy.\\n\\nAfter modifying the Pod manifest to a Deployment with three replicas and a restart policy of 'Always', the second experiment attempt passes all unit tests, confirming the system's improved resilience. This cycle demonstrates the importance of redundancy and automatic recovery in maintaining system stability under fault conditions.\"}"
