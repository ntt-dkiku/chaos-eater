    "description": "In a cyber attack scenario, the attacker might target the single point of failure in the system, which is the single Pod running the Nginx server. The Pod's restart policy is set to 'Never', meaning if it fails, it won't restart automatically, leading to downtime. Additionally, the lack of redundancy due to the single Pod deployment without a controller like Deployment or ReplicaSet makes the system vulnerable to attacks that can take down the Pod. To simulate this, we can inject a PodChaos fault to kill the Pod, testing the system's ability to maintain the steady state of service availability. This will directly test the system's weakness in handling Pod failures and its impact on the steady state of service availability. Following this, we can simulate a network partition using NetworkChaos to test if the service can still route traffic effectively, even if the Pod is isolated from the network. This sequence simulates a cyber attack where the attacker first takes down the Pod and then attempts to disrupt network communication."
