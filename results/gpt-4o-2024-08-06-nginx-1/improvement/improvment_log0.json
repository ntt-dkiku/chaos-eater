The Pod runs an Nginx container, which is a popular web server and reverse proxy server. The Service is configured to expose the Pod on port 80, which is the default port for HTTP traffic. Given these details, it is logical to assume that the application is a simple web server or a static website hosted using Nginx. The use of Nginx and the exposure of port 80 strongly suggest that the application is intended to serve web content.\n\n# Here is the hypothesis for my system:\nThe hypothesis is \"The steady states of the sytem are maintained even when the fault scenario occurs (i.e., when the faults are injected)\".\nThe steady states here are as follows:\n2 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: PodRunningStatusNginxPodYaml\n- Description: The first issue to address is the Pod's restart policy set to 'Never'. This is a critical issue because if the Pod fails, it will not restart automatically, leading to potential downtime. Therefore, the steady state should verify that the Pod is running and not in a failed state. This can be measured by checking the Pod's status to ensure it is 'Running'. This steady state is specific to the 'nginx/pod.yaml' manifest, which defines the Pod with the problematic restart policy.\n- Threshold for the steady state: The Pod should be in the 'Running' state for at least 90% of the time during the observation period.; The steady state we are considering is the Pod's running status. The current state shows that the Pod was running for 5 out of 5 seconds, which is 100% of the time. Given that the Pod's restart policy is set to 'Never', it is crucial to ensure that the Pod remains in the 'Running' state to avoid downtime. However, to account for minor fluctuations or delays in status updates, a reasonable threshold would be to expect the Pod to be in the 'Running' state for at least 90% of the time during the observation period. This allows for some tolerance while still ensuring that the Pod is generally stable and operational.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestPodRunningStatus(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self, namespace, pod_name, duration):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.namespace = namespace\n        self.pod_name = pod_name\n        self.duration = duration\n\n    def test_pod_running_status(self):\n        running_count = 0\n        # Loop for the specified duration\n        for _ in range(self.duration):\n            try:\n                # Read the Pod status\n                pod = self.v1.read_namespaced_pod(name=self.pod_name, namespace=self.namespace)\n                # Check if the Pod is in 'Running' state\n                if pod.status.phase == 'Running':\n                    running_count += 1\n                print(f\"Pod status: {pod.status.phase}\")\n            except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n                print(f\"Exception when calling CoreV1Api->read_namespaced_pod: {e}\")\n            time.sleep(1)\n        # Calculate the percentage of time the Pod was running\n        running_percentage = (running_count / self.duration) * 100\n        print(f\"Pod was running {running_count} out of {self.duration} seconds, which is {running_percentage}% of the time.\")\n        # Assert that the Pod was running at least 90% of the time\n        assert running_percentage >= 90, \"Pod did not meet the 90% running threshold.\"\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test the running status of a Kubernetes Pod.')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=5, help='Duration to check the Pod status in seconds.')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n    # Create an instance of the test class\n    test = TestPodRunningStatus(namespace='default', pod_name='example-pod', duration=args.duration)\n    # Run the test\n    test.test_pod_running_status()\n```2nd steady states:\n- Name: ServiceAvailabilityNginxServiceYaml\n- Description: The next issue to address is the lack of redundancy due to the use of a single Pod without a controller like Deployment or ReplicaSet. This can lead to a lack of automatic recovery if the Pod is deleted or fails. To verify the system's resilience, we should define a steady state that measures the availability of the web service provided by the Pod. Since the Service is responsible for exposing the Pod, we can measure the HTTP response rate or availability of the service. This steady state will ensure that the Service is consistently able to route traffic to the Pod, even if the Pod encounters issues. This is specific to the 'nginx/service.yaml' manifest, which defines the Service that selects the Pod.\n- Threshold for the steady state: HTTP response rate should be >= 99.5% with status code 200.; The steady state we are considering is the availability of the web service provided by the Nginx Pod, as measured by the HTTP response rate. The k6 test results show that 100% of the requests received a 200 status code, indicating that the service is fully available. To account for potential fluctuations and ensure the threshold is reasonable, we should allow for a small margin of error. A typical approach is to set the threshold slightly below 100% to accommodate minor network issues or transient errors that might occur in a real-world scenario. Given the current state shows perfect availability, a threshold of 99.5% would be reasonable, allowing for some tolerance while still ensuring high availability.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following K6 Javascript:\n```\nimport http from 'k6/http';\nimport { check } from 'k6';\n\nexport let options = {\n  vus: 10,\n  duration: '5s',\n  thresholds: {\n    'http_req_failed': ['rate<0.005'], // Allowing for a 0.5% failure rate\n    'http_req_duration': ['p(95)<200'], // Optional: 95% of requests should be below 200ms\n  },\n};\n\nexport default function () {\n  let res = http.get('http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:80');\n  check(res, {\n    'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,\n  });\n}\n```\n\nThe fault scenario here is as follows:\n\nAn assumed fault scenario is as follows:\n- Event: Cyber Attack\n- Used Chaos Engineering tool: Chaos Mesh\n- Faults to simulate the event: [[Fault(name='PodChaos', name_id=0, params={'action': 'pod-kill', 'mode': 'one', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}})], [Fault(name='NetworkChaos', name_id=1, params={'action': 'partition', 'mode': 'one', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}, 'direction': 'both'})]]\n- Description: In a cyber attack scenario, the attacker might target the single point of failure in the system, which is the single Pod running the Nginx server. The Pod's restart policy is set to 'Never', meaning if it fails, it won't restart automatically, leading to downtime. Additionally, the lack of redundancy due to the single Pod deployment without a controller like Deployment or ReplicaSet makes the system vulnerable to attacks that can take down the Pod. To simulate this, we can inject a PodChaos fault to kill the Pod, testing the system's ability to maintain the steady state of service availability. This will directly test the system's weakness in handling Pod failures and its impact on the steady state of service availability. Following this, we can simulate a network partition using NetworkChaos to test if the service can still route traffic effectively, even if the Pod is isolated from the network. This sequence simulates a cyber attack where the attacker first takes down the Pod and then attempts to disrupt network communication.\n\n# Here is the overview of my Chaos-Engineering experiment to verify the hypothesis:\nThe Chaos Engineering experiment is structured into three phases within a 1-minute timeframe: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation. \n\nIn the pre-validation phase, which lasts for 10 seconds, two unit tests are executed simultaneously to ensure the system is in a steady state. The first test, 'PodRunningStatusNginxPodYaml', checks the Pod's running status with a workflow named 'pre-unittest-podrunningstatusnginxpodyaml'. It starts immediately and runs for 5 seconds. Concurrently, the second test, 'ServiceAvailabilityNginxServiceYaml', verifies the service's availability using a k6 script, with a workflow named 'pre-unittest-serviceavailabilitynginxserviceyaml'. This test also starts immediately and runs for 5 seconds.\n\nThe fault-injection phase spans 30 seconds and involves two sequential fault injections. Initially, the 'PodChaos' fault is injected to simulate a pod failure, starting at the beginning of the phase and lasting for 10 seconds. This is managed by the 'fault-podchaos' workflow. Simultaneously, the unit test 'PodRunningStatusNginxPodYaml' is conducted to verify the pod's running status, starting at 0 seconds and running for 10 seconds, with the workflow 'fault-unittest-podrunningstatusnginxpodyaml'. Following this, the 'NetworkChaos' fault is injected to simulate a network partition, starting at 10 seconds and lasting for 10 seconds, managed by the 'fault-networkchaos' workflow. Concurrently, the unit test 'ServiceAvailabilityNginxServiceYaml' is executed to verify service availability, starting at 10 seconds and running for 10 seconds, with the workflow 'fault-unittest-serviceavailabilitynginxserviceyaml'.\n\nIn the post-validation phase, which lasts for 20 seconds, two unit tests are executed sequentially to ensure the system has returned to its steady state. The first test, 'PodRunningStatusNginxPodYaml', checks the Pod's running status, starting after a 2-second grace period and running for 8 seconds, with the workflow 'post-unittest-podrunningstatusnginxpodyaml'. The second test, 'ServiceAvailabilityNginxServiceYaml', verifies service availability, also starting after a 2-second grace period and running for 8 seconds, with the workflow 'post-unittest-serviceavailabilitynginxserviceyaml'. This sequential execution ensures each steady state is independently verified within the 20-second timeframe.\n\n# The experiment's results of the original system are as follows:\nPassed unittests:\n- pre-unittest-podrunningstatusnginxpodyaml\n- pre-unittest-serviceavailabilitynginxserviceyaml\nFailed unittests:\n- fault-unittest-podrunningstatusnginxpodyaml\n```log\nException when calling CoreV1Api->read_namespaced_pod: (404)\nReason: Not Found\nHTTP response headers: HTTPHeaderDict({'Audit-Id': '7aee9aab-f3f6-4c6c-93fb-c71203e5bfbc', 'Cache-Control': 'no-cache, private', 'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'X-Kubernetes-Pf-Flowschema-Uid': 'c4624bd9-7fc7-42c6-bcb8-4235110a860d', 'X-Kubernetes-Pf-Prioritylevel-Uid': '4706085f-6263-43ae-93f5-b4a61de8b6be', 'Date': 'Sun, 24 Nov 2024 12:37:45 GMT', 'Content-Length': '190'})\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n ...n', 'X-Kubernetes-Pf-Flowschema-Uid': 'c4624bd9-7fc7-42c6-bcb8-4235110a860d', 'X-Kubernetes-Pf-Prioritylevel-Uid': '4706085f-6263-43ae-93f5-b4a61de8b6be', 'Date': 'Sun, 24 Nov 2024 12:37:54 GMT', 'Content-Length': '190'})\nHTTP response body: {\"kind\":\"Status\",\"apiVersion\":\"v1\",\"metadata\":{},\"status\":\"Failure\",\"message\":\"pods \\\"example-pod\\\" not found\",\"reason\":\"NotFound\",\"details\":{\"name\":\"example-pod\",\"kind\":\"pods\"},\"code\":404}\n\n\nPod was running 0 out of 10 seconds, which is 0.0% of the time.\n\n```\n\n- fault-unittest-serviceavailabilitynginxserviceyaml\n```log\ntime=\"2024-11-24T12:37:56Z\" level=warning msg=\"Request Failed\" error=\"Get \\\"http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:80\\\": dial tcp 10.96.77.132:80: connect: connection refused\"\ntime=\"2024-11-24T12:37:56Z\" level=warning msg=\"Request Failed\" error=\"Get \\\"http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:80\\\": dial tcp 10.96.77.132:80: connect: connection refused\"\ntime=\"2024-11-24T12:37:56Z\" level=warning msg=\"Request Failed\" error=\"Get \\\"http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:8............: avg=0s    min=0s     med=0s    max=0s  p(90)=0s  p(95)=0s \n     http_reqs..................: 25      0.833154/s\n     iteration_duration.........: avg=8.19s min=4.75ms med=1.02s max=30s p(90)=30s p(95)=30s\n     iterations.................: 25      0.833154/s\n     vus........................: 4       min=4        max=10\n     vus_max....................: 10      min=10       max=10\n\ntime=\"2024-11-24T12:38:26Z\" level=error msg=\"thresholds on metrics 'http_req_failed' have been crossed\"\n\n```\n\n- post-unittest-podrunningstatusnginxpodyaml\n```log\nException when calling CoreV1Api->read_namespaced_pod: (404)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/chaos-eater/sandbox/cycle_20241124_123316/hypothesis/unittest_PodRunningStatusNginxPodYaml_mod0.py\", line 41, in <module>\n    test.test_pod_running_status()\n  File \"/chaos-eater/sandbox/cycle_20241124_123316/hypothesis/unittest_PodRunningStatusNginxPodYaml_mod0.py\", line 32, in test_pod_running_status\nReason: Not Found\n    assert running_percentage >= 90, \"Pod did not meet the 90% running t...on', 'X-Kubernetes-Pf-Flowschema-Uid': 'c4624bd9-7fc7-42c6-bcb8-4235110a860d', 'X-Kubernetes-Pf-Prioritylevel-Uid': '4706085f-6263-43ae-93f5-b4a61de8b6be', 'Date': 'Sun, 24 Nov 2024 12:38:38 GMT', 'Content-Length': '190'})\nHTTP response body: {\"kind\":\"Status\",\"apiVersion\":\"v1\",\"metadata\":{},\"status\":\"Failure\",\"message\":\"pods \\\"example-pod\\\" not found\",\"reason\":\"NotFound\",\"details\":{\"name\":\"example-pod\",\"kind\":\"pods\"},\"code\":404}\n\n\nPod was running 0 out of 8 seconds, which is 0.0% of the time.\n\n```\n\n- post-unittest-serviceavailabilitynginxserviceyaml\n```log\ntime=\"2024-11-24T12:38:33Z\" level=warning msg=\"Request Failed\" error=\"Get \\\"http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:80\\\": dial tcp 10.96.77.132:80: connect: connection refused\"\ntime=\"2024-11-24T12:38:33Z\" level=warning msg=\"Request Failed\" error=\"Get \\\"http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:80\\\": dial tcp 10.96.77.132:80: connect: connection refused\"\ntime=\"2024-11-24T12:38:33Z\" level=warning msg=\"Request Failed\" error=\"Get \\\"http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:8... avg=0s    min=0s     med=0s    max=0s  p(90)=0s     p(95)=0s   \n     http_reqs..................: 24      0.799817/s\n     iteration_duration.........: avg=6.94s min=4.05ms med=2.02s max=30s p(90)=15.38s p(95)=27.8s\n     iterations.................: 24      0.799817/s\n     vus........................: 2       min=2        max=10\n     vus_max....................: 10      min=10       max=10\n\ntime=\"2024-11-24T12:39:04Z\" level=error msg=\"thresholds on metrics 'http_req_failed' have been crossed\"\n\n```\n\n\nFirst, please analyze the results and provide an analysis report rich in insights.\nAI: # Here is my analysis report:\nThe Chaos Engineering experiment results indicate a failure in maintaining the steady states during and after the fault injection phase. Let's analyze the reasons for these failures step by step:\n\n1. **Pre-Validation Phase Success**: Both pre-validation tests passed, indicating that the system was initially in a steady state. The Pod was running, and the service was available, confirming that the system was correctly set up before the fault injection.\n\n2. **Fault Injection Phase Failures**:\n   - **PodChaos Fault**: The 'PodChaos' fault was injected to kill the Pod. The test 'fault-unittest-podrunningstatusnginxpodyaml' failed because the Pod was not found (HTTP 404 error). This is expected behavior given the Pod's restart policy is set to 'Never', meaning it does not automatically restart after being killed. This confirms the identified resiliency issue #0 (Pod Restart Policy) and issue #1 (Single Pod Deployment) in the system configuration.\n   - **NetworkChaos Fault**: The 'NetworkChaos' fault was injected to simulate a network partition. The test 'fault-unittest-serviceavailabilitynginxserviceyaml' failed because the service was unable to connect to the Pod (connection refused errors). This failure is a direct consequence of the Pod being unavailable due to the PodChaos fault, highlighting the lack of redundancy and automatic recovery mechanisms in the system.\n\n3. **Post-Validation Phase Failures**:\n   - **Pod Running Status**: The 'post-unittest-podrunningstatusnginxpodyaml' test failed because the Pod was still not found. This indicates that the system did not recover from the PodChaos fault, as expected due to the 'Never' restart policy.\n   - **Service Availability**: The 'post-unittest-serviceavailabilitynginxserviceyaml' test also failed, with continued connection refused errors. This further confirms that the service could not route traffic because the Pod was not running, emphasizing the impact of the single Pod deployment without redundancy.\n\n**Insights and Recommendations**:\n- **Pod Restart Policy**: Change the Pod's restart policy from 'Never' to 'Always' or 'OnFailure' to ensure automatic recovery in case of failures.\n- **Redundancy and Scalability**: Deploy the Pod using a Deployment or ReplicaSet to manage multiple replicas, providing redundancy and automatic recovery. This will mitigate the single point of failure issue and improve the system's resilience against Pod failures.\n- **Service Resilience**: Ensure that the Service can handle Pod failures by having multiple Pods behind it. This can be achieved by scaling the Deployment to have more replicas.\n\nBy addressing these issues, the system will be better equipped to maintain its steady states even when faults are injected, thus improving its overall resilience.\nHuman: Then, please reconfigure the system to avoid the fails (improve resiliency).\nAI: ```json\n{\"thought\":"
