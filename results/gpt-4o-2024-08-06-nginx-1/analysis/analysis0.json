    "report": "The Chaos Engineering experiment results indicate a failure in maintaining the steady states during and after the fault injection phase. Let's analyze the reasons for these failures step by step:\n\n1. **Pre-Validation Phase Success**: Both pre-validation tests passed, indicating that the system was initially in a steady state. The Pod was running, and the service was available, confirming that the system was correctly set up before the fault injection.\n\n2. **Fault Injection Phase Failures**:\n   - **PodChaos Fault**: The 'PodChaos' fault was injected to kill the Pod. The test 'fault-unittest-podrunningstatusnginxpodyaml' failed because the Pod was not found (HTTP 404 error). This is expected behavior given the Pod's restart policy is set to 'Never', meaning it does not automatically restart after being killed. This confirms the identified resiliency issue #0 (Pod Restart Policy) and issue #1 (Single Pod Deployment) in the system configuration.\n   - **NetworkChaos Fault**: The 'NetworkChaos' fault was injected to simulate a network partition. The test 'fault-unittest-serviceavailabilitynginxserviceyaml' failed because the service was unable to connect to the Pod (connection refused errors). This failure is a direct consequence of the Pod being unavailable due to the PodChaos fault, highlighting the lack of redundancy and automatic recovery mechanisms in the system.\n\n3. **Post-Validation Phase Failures**:\n   - **Pod Running Status**: The 'post-unittest-podrunningstatusnginxpodyaml' test failed because the Pod was still not found. This indicates that the system did not recover from the PodChaos fault, as expected due to the 'Never' restart policy.\n   - **Service Availability**: The 'post-unittest-serviceavailabilitynginxserviceyaml' test also failed, with continued connection refused errors. This further confirms that the service could not route traffic because the Pod was not running, emphasizing the impact of the single Pod deployment without redundancy.\n\n**Insights and Recommendations**:\n- **Pod Restart Policy**: Change the Pod's restart policy from 'Never' to 'Always' or 'OnFailure' to ensure automatic recovery in case of failures.\n- **Redundancy and Scalability**: Deploy the Pod using a Deployment or ReplicaSet to manage multiple replicas, providing redundancy and automatic recovery. This will mitigate the single point of failure issue and improve the system's resilience against Pod failures.\n- **Service Resilience**: Ensure that the Service can handle Pod failures by having multiple Pods behind it. This can be achieved by scaling the Deployment to have more replicas.\n\nBy addressing these issues, the system will be better equipped to maintain its steady states even when faults are injected, thus improving its overall resilience."
