If the Pod fails, the service will be unavailable.\n  - manifests having the issues: ['nginx/pod.yaml']\n  - problematic config: Only one Pod is defined without a Deployment or ReplicaSet.\n\nThe expected type of application on the system (i.e., K8s manfests):\nA simple web server application using Nginx to serve HTTP content.; The manifests provided define a Kubernetes Pod and a Service. The Pod runs an Nginx container, which is a popular web server used to serve static content, reverse proxy, or load balance HTTP traffic. The Service is configured to expose this Pod on port 80, which is the default port for HTTP traffic. Given the use of Nginx and the configuration of the Service, it is logical to assume that these manifests are intended to deploy a simple web server application. The file names and the use of Nginx further support this assumption.\n\n# Here is the hypothesis for my system:\nThe hypothesis is \"The steady states of the sytem are maintained even when the fault scenario occurs (i.e., when the faults are injected)\".\nThe steady states here are as follows:\n2 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: example-pod-running\n- Description: The first issue to address is the Pod's restart policy set to 'Never'. This is a critical issue because if the Pod fails, it will not restart, leading to potential downtime. Therefore, the steady state should ensure that the Pod is running and available. A measurable output for this steady state is the number of running Pods, which should be 1, as there is only one Pod defined in the manifest. This steady state will help verify that the Pod is up and running, which is crucial given the restart policy configuration.\n- Threshold for the steady state: The pod should be running at least 90% of the time during the check period.; The steady state we are considering is whether the 'example-pod' is running. The current state shows that the pod was checked 5 times over a duration of 5 seconds, and it was running each time, resulting in a running count of 5. This indicates that the pod is consistently running during the check period. Given the constraints of the chaos engineering experiment, which must be completed within 1 minute, we can set a threshold that allows for some tolerance in case of brief fluctuations. A reasonable threshold would be that the pod should be running at least 90% of the time during the check period. This allows for a small margin of error while still ensuring that the pod is generally available and running.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestPodRunningState(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n\n    def check_pod_status(self, namespace, pod_name):\n        try:\n            pod = self.v1.read_namespaced_pod(name=pod_name, namespace=namespace)\n            return pod.status.phase == 'Running'\n        except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n            print(f\"Exception when calling CoreV1Api->read_namespaced_pod: {e}\")\n            return False\n\n    def test_pod_running_state(self, duration):\n        namespace = 'default'\n        pod_name = 'example-pod'\n        running_count = 0\n\n        # Check the pod status every second for the specified duration\n        for _ in range(duration):\n            if self.check_pod_status(namespace, pod_name):\n                running_count += 1\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the running percentage\n        running_percentage = (running_count / duration) * 100\n\n        # Assert that the running percentage is at least 90%\n        assert running_percentage >= 90, f\"Pod '{pod_name}' running percentage is below threshold: {running_percentage}%\"\n\n        print(f\"Pod '{pod_name}' running status checked {duration} times. Running percentage: {running_percentage}%.\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test if a pod is running at least 90% of the time.')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=5, help='Duration to check the pod status in seconds.')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    test = TestPodRunningState()\n    test.test_pod_running_state(args.duration)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```2nd steady states:\n- Name: example-service-availability\n- Description: The next issue to address is the 'Single Pod Deployment', which is related to the lack of redundancy. This is a significant issue because if the single Pod fails, the service will be unavailable. To verify this, we can define a steady state that checks the availability of the service itself. A measurable output for this steady state is the service's response time or availability. Since the service is exposed on port 80, we can check if the service is responding to HTTP requests. This steady state will help verify that the service is available and responsive, which is crucial given the single Pod deployment configuration.\n- Threshold for the steady state: Service availability should be at least 99.9% with a response status of 200.; The steady state we are considering is the availability of the 'example-service'. The k6 test results show that the service is currently responding with a 200 status code for all requests, indicating 100% availability. Given that the system consists of a single Pod, any failure in the Pod would result in the service being unavailable. Therefore, the threshold should ensure that the service remains available and responsive. To account for minor fluctuations and network latency, a reasonable threshold would be to maintain a high availability percentage, slightly below 100% to allow for brief, non-critical failures. A threshold of 99.9% availability is a common standard for web services, allowing for some tolerance while still ensuring high reliability.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following K6 Javascript:\n```\nimport http from 'k6/http';\nimport { check } from 'k6';\n\nexport const options = {\n  vus: 1,\n  duration: '5s',\n  thresholds: {\n    // Ensure that the service availability is at least 99.9%\n    'http_req_failed': ['rate<=0.001'], // 0.1% failure rate corresponds to 99.9% availability\n  },\n};\n\nexport default function () {\n  const res = http.get('http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:80');\n  check(res, {\n    'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,\n  });\n}\n\n```\n\nThe fault scenario here is as follows:\n\nAn assumed fault scenario is as follows:\n- Event: Cyber Attack\n- Used Chaos Engineering tool: Chaos Mesh\n- Faults to simulate the event: [[Fault(name='PodChaos', name_id=0, params={'action': 'pod-kill', 'mode': 'one', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}})], [Fault(name='NetworkChaos', name_id=1, params={'action': 'delay', 'direction': 'to', 'target': {'mode': 'all', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}}, 'mode': 'all', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}, 'device': 'eth0', 'delay': {'latency': '100ms', 'jitter': '10ms', 'correlation': '50'}})]]\n- Description: Given the system's weaknesses, a cyber attack targeting the single Pod and its network could be highly impactful. The Pod's restart policy set to 'Never' means that if the Pod fails, it will not restart, leading to downtime. Additionally, the single Pod deployment means there is no redundancy, so any failure will make the service unavailable. To simulate a cyber attack, we can start by injecting a PodChaos fault to kill the Pod, testing the system's ability to handle Pod failures. This will directly exploit the lack of redundancy and the restart policy issue. Next, we can simulate a network attack using NetworkChaos to introduce network latency, testing the service's ability to maintain availability under network stress. This sequence simulates a cyber attack by first taking down the Pod and then stressing the network, revealing the system's vulnerabilities in handling such scenarios.\n\n# Here is the overview of my Chaos-Engineering experiment to verify the hypothesis:\nThe chaos engineering experiment is structured into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation, all to be completed within a total of 60 seconds. \n\nIn the pre-validation phase, which lasts for 15 seconds, two unit tests are conducted sequentially to ensure the system is in a steady state before fault injection. The first test, named 'pre-unittest-example-pod-running', checks the 'example-pod' running status. It starts immediately at the beginning of the phase and runs for 5 seconds. Following this, the second test, 'pre-unittest-example-service-availability', begins at the 5-second mark and also runs for 5 seconds, verifying the service's availability.\n\nThe fault-injection phase spans 30 seconds and involves two types of faults: PodChaos and NetworkChaos. Initially, the PodChaos fault, named 'fault-podchaos', is injected at the start of the phase and lasts for 10 seconds. Concurrently, the 'fault-unittest-example-pod-running' unit test runs for the same duration to verify the pod's status during the fault. After the PodChaos fault concludes, the NetworkChaos fault, named 'fault-networkchaos', begins at the 10-second mark and continues for 20 seconds. Simultaneously, the 'fault-unittest-example-service-availability' test runs for 20 seconds, starting at the same time as the NetworkChaos fault, to check the service's availability under network stress.\n\nFinally, the post-validation phase, also 15 seconds long, ensures the system returns to its steady states. The 'post-unittest-example-pod-running' test starts after a 2-second grace period and runs for 6 seconds to verify the pod's status. Subsequently, the 'post-unittest-example-service-availability' test begins at the 8-second mark and runs for 5 seconds, checking the service's availability. This sequential execution allows for a brief stabilization period before each test.\n\n# The experiment's results of the original system are as follows:\nPassed unittests:\n- pre-unittest-example-pod-running\n- pre-unittest-example-service-availability\nFailed unittests:\n- fault-unittest-example-pod-running\n```log\nException when calling CoreV1Api->read_namespaced_pod: (404)\nReason: Not Found\nHTTP response headers: HTTPHeaderDict({'Audit-Id': '71a5fb6f-8e8c-4e31-9bc2-db80df08c498', 'Cache-Control': 'no-cache, private', 'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'X-Kubernetes-Pf-Flowschema-Uid': 'c4624bd9-7fc7-42c6-bcb8-4235110a860d', 'X-Kubernetes-Pf-Prioritylevel-Uid': '4706085f-6263-43ae-93f5-b4a61de8b6be', 'Date': 'Sun, 24 Nov 2024 13:25:18 GMT', 'Content-Length': '190'})\nHTTP response body: {\"kind\":\"Status\"...-Control': 'no-cache, private', 'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'X-Kubernetes-Pf-Flowschema-Uid': 'c4624bd9-7fc7-42c6-bcb8-4235110a860d', 'X-Kubernetes-Pf-Prioritylevel-Uid': '4706085f-6263-43ae-93f5-b4a61de8b6be', 'Date': 'Sun, 24 Nov 2024 13:25:27 GMT', 'Content-Length': '190'})\nHTTP response body: {\"kind\":\"Status\",\"apiVersion\":\"v1\",\"metadata\":{},\"status\":\"Failure\",\"message\":\"pods \\\"example-pod\\\" not found\",\"reason\":\"NotFound\",\"details\":{\"name\":\"example-pod\",\"kind\":\"pods\"},\"code\":404}\n\n\n\n```\n\n- fault-unittest-example-service-availability\n```log\ntime=\"2024-11-24T13:25:29Z\" level=warning msg=\"Request Failed\" error=\"Get \\\"http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:80\\\": dial tcp 10.96.152.112:80: connect: connection refused\"\ntime=\"2024-11-24T13:25:29Z\" level=warning msg=\"Request Failed\" error=\"Get \\\"http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:80\\\": dial tcp 10.96.152.112:80: connect: connection refused\"\ntime=\"2024-11-24T13:25:29Z\" level=warning msg=\"Request Failed\" error=\"Get \\\"http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local...    min=0s       med=0s    max=0s    p(90)=0s    p(95)=0s   \n     http_reqs..................: 26      1.269887/s\n     iteration_duration.........: avg=787.43ms min=287.51\u00b5s med=1.02s max=1.02s p(90)=1.02s p(95)=1.02s\n     iterations.................: 26      1.269887/s\n     vus........................: 1       min=1        max=1\n     vus_max....................: 1       min=1        max=1\n\ntime=\"2024-11-24T13:25:49Z\" level=error msg=\"thresholds on metrics 'http_req_failed' have been crossed\"\n\n```\n\n- post-unittest-example-pod-running\n```log\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/chaos-eater/sandbox/cycle_20241124_132128/hypothesis/unittest_example-pod-running_mod0.py\", line 49, in <module>\nException when calling CoreV1Api->read_namespaced_pod: (404)\nReason: Not Found\nHTTP response headers: HTTPHeaderDict({'Audit-Id': '8a587dad-5e7d-44d6-b9a5-dd6a14dc6125', 'Cache-Control': 'no-cache, private', 'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'X-Kubernetes-Pf-Flowschema-Uid': 'c4624bd9-7fc7-42c6-bcb8-4235110a860d', 'X-Kubernetes-Pf-Priori...-Control': 'no-cache, private', 'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'X-Kubernetes-Pf-Flowschema-Uid': 'c4624bd9-7fc7-42c6-bcb8-4235110a860d', 'X-Kubernetes-Pf-Prioritylevel-Uid': '4706085f-6263-43ae-93f5-b4a61de8b6be', 'Date': 'Sun, 24 Nov 2024 13:26:02 GMT', 'Content-Length': '190'})\nHTTP response body: {\"kind\":\"Status\",\"apiVersion\":\"v1\",\"metadata\":{},\"status\":\"Failure\",\"message\":\"pods \\\"example-pod\\\" not found\",\"reason\":\"NotFound\",\"details\":{\"name\":\"example-pod\",\"kind\":\"pods\"},\"code\":404}\n\n\n\n```\n\n- post-unittest-example-service-availability\n```log\ntime=\"2024-11-24T13:26:02Z\" level=warning msg=\"Request Failed\" error=\"Get \\\"http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:80\\\": dial tcp 10.96.152.112:80: connect: connection refused\"\ntime=\"2024-11-24T13:26:02Z\" level=warning msg=\"Request Failed\" error=\"Get \\\"http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:80\\\": dial tcp 10.96.152.112:80: connect: connection refused\"\ntime=\"2024-11-24T13:26:02Z\" level=warning msg=\"Request Failed\" error=\"Get \\\"http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local...    min=0s       med=0s     max=0s    p(90)=0s    p(95)=0s   \n     http_reqs..................: 11      2.14294/s\n     iteration_duration.........: avg=466.61ms min=211.73\u00b5s med=3.98ms max=1.03s p(90)=1.02s p(95)=1.02s\n     iterations.................: 11      2.14294/s\n     vus........................: 1       min=1        max=1\n     vus_max....................: 1       min=1        max=1\n\ntime=\"2024-11-24T13:26:08Z\" level=error msg=\"thresholds on metrics 'http_req_failed' have been crossed\"\n\n```\n\n\nFirst, please analyze the results and provide an analysis report rich in insights.\nAI: # Here is my analysis report:\nThe chaos engineering experiment results indicate several critical issues in the system's configuration and its ability to handle faults, particularly in the context of the defined fault scenario. Here is a detailed analysis of the failures observed during the experiment:\n\n1. **Pod Restart Policy and Single Pod Deployment**:\n   - The 'fault-unittest-example-pod-running' test failed because the Pod was not found after the PodChaos fault was injected. This is directly related to the Pod's restart policy set to 'Never' in the `nginx/pod.yaml` manifest. When the Pod was killed, it did not restart, leading to a 404 error when attempting to read the Pod's status. This confirms the identified issue #0 (Pod Restart Policy) and issue #1 (Single Pod Deployment), where the lack of redundancy and automatic recovery mechanisms resulted in the Pod being unavailable.\n\n2. **Service Availability**:\n   - The 'fault-unittest-example-service-availability' test failed due to connection refusals, indicating that the service was unavailable. This failure is a consequence of the Pod being killed and not restarting, as the Service relies on the Pod to handle requests. The Service's selector in `nginx/service.yaml` targets Pods with the label 'app: example', and with the Pod being down, there were no endpoints available to serve the requests, leading to the connection refused errors.\n\n3. **Post-Validation Failures**:\n   - Both 'post-unittest-example-pod-running' and 'post-unittest-example-service-availability' tests failed, showing that the system did not recover to its steady state after the fault injection. The Pod remained unavailable, and consequently, the Service could not respond to HTTP requests. This further highlights the critical impact of the Pod's restart policy and the lack of redundancy.\n\n**Insights and Recommendations**:\n- **Pod Restart Policy**: Change the Pod's restart policy from 'Never' to 'Always' or 'OnFailure' to ensure that the Pod automatically restarts if it fails. This will help maintain the Pod's availability and reduce downtime.\n- **Redundancy and Scalability**: Implement a Deployment or ReplicaSet to manage the Pod. This will provide redundancy by running multiple replicas of the Pod, ensuring that the Service remains available even if one Pod fails.\n- **Service Resilience**: Consider using a LoadBalancer or Ingress to manage traffic to multiple Pods, enhancing the system's ability to handle failures and maintain service availability.\n\nBy addressing these issues, the system can improve its resilience against similar fault scenarios in the future, ensuring that the steady states are maintained even when faults are injected.\nHuman: Then, please reconfigure the system to avoid the fails (improve resiliency).\nAI: ```json\n{\"thought\":"
