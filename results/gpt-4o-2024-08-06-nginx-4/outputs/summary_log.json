User-input understanding\n### Here is the overview of user inputs:\nThe system consists of the following K8s manifest(s):K8s manifest: nginx/pod.yaml\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: example-pod\n  labels:\n    app: example\nspec:\n  restartPolicy: Never\n  containers:\n  - name: example-container\n    image: nginx:1.17.1\n    ports:\n    - containerPort: 80\n```\nSummary of nginx/pod.yaml:\n- This manifest defines a Kubernetes Pod.\n- The Pod is named 'example-pod'.\n- It includes metadata with a label 'app: example'.\n- The Pod's restart policy is set to 'Never', meaning it won't restart automatically if it fails.\n- The Pod contains one container named 'example-container'.\n- The container uses the 'nginx:1.17.1' image, which is a specific version of the Nginx web server.\n- The container exposes port 80, which is commonly used for HTTP traffic.\n\nK8s manifest: nginx/service.yaml\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: example-service\nspec:\n  selector:\n    app: example\n  ports:\n    - protocol: TCP\n      port: 80\n      targetPort: 80\n```\nSummary of nginx/service.yaml:\n- This manifest defines a Kubernetes Service.\n- The Service is named 'example-service'.\n- It uses the 'v1' API version.\n- The Service selects pods with the label 'app: example'.\n- It exposes the Service on port 80 using the TCP protocol.\n- The Service forwards traffic to the target port 80 on the selected pods.\n\nThe resiliency issues/weaknesses in the system are as follows:\nIssue #0: Pod Restart Policy\n  - details: The Pod will not restart automatically if it fails, which can lead to downtime.\n  - manifests having the issues: ['nginx/pod.yaml']\n  - problematic config: restartPolicy: Never\n\nIssue #1: Single Pod Deployment\n  - details: Having a single Pod means there is no redundancy. If the Pod fails, the service will be unavailable.\n  - manifests having the issues: ['nginx/pod.yaml']\n  - problematic config: Only one Pod is defined without a Deployment or ReplicaSet.\n\nThe expected type of application on the system (i.e., K8s manfests):\nA simple web server application using Nginx to serve HTTP content.; The manifests provided define a Kubernetes Pod and a Service. The Pod runs an Nginx container, which is a popular web server used to serve static content, reverse proxy, or load balance HTTP traffic. The Service is configured to expose this Pod on port 80, which is the default port for HTTP traffic. Given the use of Nginx and the configuration of the Service, it is logical to assume that these manifests are intended to deploy a simple web server application. The file names and the use of Nginx further support this assumption.\n\nChaos-Engineering instructions for the system are as follows: - The Chaos-Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute.\n\n## Step 1. Hypothesis definition\n### Here is the overview of the hypothesis for the system:\nThe hypothesis is \"The steady states of the sytem are maintained even when the fault scenario occurs (i.e., when the faults are injected)\".\nThe steady states here are as follows:\n2 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: example-pod-running\n- Description: The first issue to address is the Pod's restart policy set to 'Never'. This is a critical issue because if the Pod fails, it will not restart, leading to potential downtime. Therefore, the steady state should ensure that the Pod is running and available. A measurable output for this steady state is the number of running Pods, which should be 1, as there is only one Pod defined in the manifest. This steady state will help verify that the Pod is up and running, which is crucial given the restart policy configuration.\n- Threshold for the steady state: The pod should be running at least 90% of the time during the check period.; The steady state we are considering is whether the 'example-pod' is running. The current state shows that the pod was checked 5 times over a duration of 5 seconds, and it was running each time, resulting in a running count of 5. This indicates that the pod is consistently running during the check period. Given the constraints of the chaos engineering experiment, which must be completed within 1 minute, we can set a threshold that allows for some tolerance in case of brief fluctuations. A reasonable threshold would be that the pod should be running at least 90% of the time during the check period. This allows for a small margin of error while still ensuring that the pod is generally available and running.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestPodRunningState(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n\n    def check_pod_status(self, namespace, pod_name):\n        try:\n            pod = self.v1.read_namespaced_pod(name=pod_name, namespace=namespace)\n            return pod.status.phase == 'Running'\n        except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n            print(f\"Exception when calling CoreV1Api->read_namespaced_pod: {e}\")\n            return False\n\n    def test_pod_running_state(self, duration):\n        namespace = 'default'\n        pod_name = 'example-pod'\n        running_count = 0\n\n        # Check the pod status every second for the specified duration\n        for _ in range(duration):\n            if self.check_pod_status(namespace, pod_name):\n                running_count += 1\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the running percentage\n        running_percentage = (running_count / duration) * 100\n\n        # Assert that the running percentage is at least 90%\n        assert running_percentage >= 90, f\"Pod '{pod_name}' running percentage is below threshold: {running_percentage}%\"\n\n        print(f\"Pod '{pod_name}' running status checked {duration} times. Running percentage: {running_percentage}%.\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test if a pod is running at least 90% of the time.')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=5, help='Duration to check the pod status in seconds.')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    test = TestPodRunningState()\n    test.test_pod_running_state(args.duration)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```2nd steady states:\n- Name: example-service-availability\n- Description: The next issue to address is the 'Single Pod Deployment', which is related to the lack of redundancy. This is a significant issue because if the single Pod fails, the service will be unavailable. To verify this, we can define a steady state that checks the availability of the service itself. A measurable output for this steady state is the service's response time or availability. Since the service is exposed on port 80, we can check if the service is responding to HTTP requests. This steady state will help verify that the service is available and responsive, which is crucial given the single Pod deployment configuration.\n- Threshold for the steady state: Service availability should be at least 99.9% with a response status of 200.; The steady state we are considering is the availability of the 'example-service'. The k6 test results show that the service is currently responding with a 200 status code for all requests, indicating 100% availability. Given that the system consists of a single Pod, any failure in the Pod would result in the service being unavailable. Therefore, the threshold should ensure that the service remains available and responsive. To account for minor fluctuations and network latency, a reasonable threshold would be to maintain a high availability percentage, slightly below 100% to allow for brief, non-critical failures. A threshold of 99.9% availability is a common standard for web services, allowing for some tolerance while still ensuring high reliability.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following K6 Javascript:\n```\nimport http from 'k6/http';\nimport { check } from 'k6';\n\nexport const options = {\n  vus: 1,\n  duration: '5s',\n  thresholds: {\n    // Ensure that the service availability is at least 99.9%\n    'http_req_failed': ['rate<=0.001'], // 0.1% failure rate corresponds to 99.9% availability\n  },\n};\n\nexport default function () {\n  const res = http.get('http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:80');\n  check(res, {\n    'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,\n  });\n}\n\n```\n\nThe fault scenario here is as follows:\n\nAn assumed fault scenario is as follows:\n- Event: Cyber Attack\n- Used Chaos Engineering tool: Chaos Mesh\n- Faults to simulate the event: [[Fault(name='PodChaos', name_id=0, params={'action': 'pod-kill', 'mode': 'one', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}})], [Fault(name='NetworkChaos', name_id=1, params={'action': 'delay', 'direction': 'to', 'target': {'mode': 'all', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}}, 'mode': 'all', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}, 'device': 'eth0', 'delay': {'latency': '100ms', 'jitter': '10ms', 'correlation': '50'}})]]\n- Description: Given the system's weaknesses, a cyber attack targeting the single Pod and its network could be highly impactful. The Pod's restart policy set to 'Never' means that if the Pod fails, it will not restart, leading to downtime. Additionally, the single Pod deployment means there is no redundancy, so any failure will make the service unavailable. To simulate a cyber attack, we can start by injecting a PodChaos fault to kill the Pod, testing the system's ability to handle Pod failures. This will directly exploit the lack of redundancy and the restart policy issue. Next, we can simulate a network attack using NetworkChaos to introduce network latency, testing the service's ability to maintain availability under network stress. This sequence simulates a cyber attack by first taking down the Pod and then stressing the network, revealing the system's vulnerabilities in handling such scenarios.\n\n## Step 2.1. Chaos-Engineering experiment\n### Here is the overview of my Chaos-Engineering experiment to verify the hypothesis:\nThe entire time schedule of the Chaos-Engineering experiment is as follows (The experiment is divided into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation phases):\nGiven the constraints of the chaos engineering experiment, which must be completed within 1 minute, we need to allocate time efficiently across the three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation. The pre-validation phase is crucial to ensure that the system is in a steady state before we introduce any faults. Since we have two steady states to validate, we should allocate a reasonable amount of time to check both the pod's running status and the service's availability. A duration of 15 seconds should be sufficient for pre-validation, allowing us to run the necessary checks multiple times. The fault-injection phase is where we introduce the chaos to observe the system's behavior under stress. Given the complexity of the faults (PodChaos and NetworkChaos), we should allocate the majority of the time to this phase to ensure that the faults have enough time to manifest and impact the system. A duration of 30 seconds is appropriate for fault injection, allowing us to observe the system's response to both pod failure and network latency. Finally, the post-validation phase is essential to verify that the system returns to its steady states after the faults are removed. We should allocate 15 seconds for post-validation, similar to the pre-validation phase, to ensure that the system stabilizes and meets the defined thresholds for steady states. This allocation results in a total experiment time of 60 seconds, which fits within the 1-minute constraint.\n- Total experiment phase: 60s\n- Pre-validation phase: 15s\n- Fault-injection phase: 30s\n- Post-validation phase: 15s\n\nThe details of the three phases are as follows:\nPre-validation Phase (15s):\nIn the pre-validation phase, we need to ensure that the system is in its expected steady state before we proceed with fault injection. Given the constraints of a 15-second total time for this phase, we will conduct two unit tests to verify the steady states: one for the pod's running status and another for the service's availability. These tests will be executed sequentially due to the short duration available, ensuring that each steady state is verified independently and thoroughly. The first test will check if the 'example-pod' is running at least 90% of the time over a 5-second period. This is crucial because the pod's restart policy is set to 'Never', and we need to confirm its availability before introducing any faults. The second test will verify the 'example-service' availability, ensuring it responds with a 200 status code at least 99.9% of the time over another 5-second period. This test is essential to confirm that the service is operational and responsive, given the single pod deployment. By staggering these tests, we can focus on each steady state individually, allowing us to identify any issues before proceeding to the fault injection phase.\n\nFault-injection Phase (30s):\nIn this fault-injection phase, we aim to simulate a cyber attack by injecting two types of faults: PodChaos and NetworkChaos. The total duration for this phase is 30 seconds, so we need to carefully schedule the faults and unit tests to fit within this timeframe. \n\nFirst, we will inject the PodChaos fault to simulate a pod failure. This fault will be injected at the start of the phase (grace period of 0s) and will last for 10 seconds. This duration is chosen to allow enough time for the system to experience the impact of the pod being killed, given the pod's restart policy is set to 'Never'.\n\nSimultaneously, we will run the unit test for the 'example-pod-running' steady state to verify if the pod is running at least 90% of the time during the fault injection. This test will also start at 0s and run for 10 seconds, aligning with the PodChaos duration.\n\nNext, we will inject the NetworkChaos fault to simulate network latency. This fault will start at 10 seconds (after the PodChaos fault ends) and will last for 20 seconds. This staggered approach allows us to observe the system's behavior under network stress after the pod failure has been simulated.\n\nDuring the NetworkChaos fault, we will run the unit test for the 'example-service-availability' steady state. This test will start at 10 seconds and run for 20 seconds, matching the NetworkChaos duration. This ensures we are checking the service's availability and response time while the network is under stress.\n\nBy staggering the faults and aligning the unit tests with the fault durations, we can effectively observe the system's behavior under each fault condition and verify if the steady states are maintained.\n\nPost-validation Phase (15s):\nIn the post-validation phase, we need to ensure that the system has returned to its steady states after the fault injection. Given the 15-second time constraint, we will perform quick checks to verify the steady states. The two steady states to verify are: 1) the 'example-pod' is running, and 2) the 'example-service' is available. We will execute these checks sequentially due to the short duration, ensuring each test has enough time to gather meaningful data. The first test will check the pod's running status, followed by the service availability test. This order is logical because the pod must be running for the service to be available. Each test will have a brief grace period to allow the system to stabilize after the fault injection, followed by a short duration to perform the checks.\n\nThe summary of the above experiment plan:\nThe chaos engineering experiment is structured into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation, all to be completed within a total of 60 seconds. \n\nIn the pre-validation phase, which lasts for 15 seconds, two unit tests are conducted sequentially to ensure the system is in a steady state before fault injection. The first test, named 'pre-unittest-example-pod-running', checks the 'example-pod' running status. It starts immediately at the beginning of the phase and runs for 5 seconds. Following this, the second test, 'pre-unittest-example-service-availability', begins at the 5-second mark and also runs for 5 seconds, verifying the service's availability.\n\nThe fault-injection phase spans 30 seconds and involves two types of faults: PodChaos and NetworkChaos. Initially, the PodChaos fault, named 'fault-podchaos', is injected at the start of the phase and lasts for 10 seconds. Concurrently, the 'fault-unittest-example-pod-running' unit test runs for the same duration to verify the pod's status during the fault. After the PodChaos fault concludes, the NetworkChaos fault, named 'fault-networkchaos', begins at the 10-second mark and continues for 20 seconds. Simultaneously, the 'fault-unittest-example-service-availability' test runs for 20 seconds, starting at the same time as the NetworkChaos fault, to check the service's availability under network stress.\n\nFinally, the post-validation phase, also 15 seconds long, ensures the system returns to its steady states. The 'post-unittest-example-pod-running' test starts after a 2-second grace period and runs for 6 seconds to verify the pod's status. Subsequently, the 'post-unittest-example-service-availability' test begins at the 8-second mark and runs for 5 seconds, checking the service's availability. This sequential execution allows for a brief stabilization period before each test.\n\nTo automatically conduct the above experiment plan with Chaos Mesh, the following Chaos-Mesh-Worfklow file was created (by applying it to the cluster, the experiment plan will be automatically executed according to the Chaos-Mesh-Worfklow file):\n```yaml\napiVersion: chaos-mesh.org/v1alpha1\nkind: Workflow\nmetadata:\n  name: chaos-experiment-20241124-132854\nspec:\n  entry: the-entry\n  templates:\n    #-------------------------------\n    # entry point of whole workflow\n    #-------------------------------\n    -

Here is a detailed analysis of the failures observed during the experiment:\n\n1. **Pod Restart Policy and Single Pod Deployment**:\n   - The 'fault-unittest-example-pod-running' test failed because the Pod was not found after the PodChaos fault was injected. This is directly related to the Pod's restart policy set to 'Never' in the `nginx/pod.yaml` manifest. When the Pod was killed, it did not restart, leading to a 404 error when attempting to read the Pod's status. This confirms the identified issue #0 (Pod Restart Policy) and issue #1 (Single Pod Deployment), where the lack of redundancy and automatic recovery mechanisms resulted in the Pod being unavailable.\n\n2. **Service Availability**:\n   - The 'fault-unittest-example-service-availability' test failed due to connection refusals, indicating that the service was unavailable. This failure is a consequence of the Pod being killed and not restarting, as the Service relies on the Pod to handle requests. The Service's selector in `nginx/service.yaml` targets Pods with the label 'app: example', and with the Pod being down, there were no endpoints available to serve the requests, leading to the connection refused errors.\n\n3. **Post-Validation Failures**:\n   - Both 'post-unittest-example-pod-running' and 'post-unittest-example-service-availability' tests failed, showing that the system did not recover to its steady state after the fault injection. The Pod remained unavailable, and consequently, the Service could not respond to HTTP requests. This further highlights the critical impact of the Pod's restart policy and the lack of redundancy.\n\n**Insights and Recommendations**:\n- **Pod Restart Policy**: Change the Pod's restart policy from 'Never' to 'Always' or 'OnFailure' to ensure that the Pod automatically restarts if it fails. This will help maintain the Pod's availability and reduce downtime.\n- **Redundancy and Scalability**: Implement a Deployment or ReplicaSet to manage the Pod. This will provide redundancy by running multiple replicas of the Pod, ensuring that the Service remains available even if one Pod fails.\n- **Service Resilience**: Consider using a LoadBalancer or Ingress to manage traffic to multiple Pods, enhancing the system's ability to handle failures and maintain service availability.\n\nBy addressing these issues, the system can improve its resilience against similar fault scenarios in the future, ensuring that the steady states are maintained even when faults are injected.\n\n### Improvement result (1st try)\n1 K8s manifests are modified:\n- The K8s manifest 'nginx/pod.yaml' was replaced.\nReplace the Pod with a Deployment to manage the Pod's lifecycle and provide redundancy. This will ensure that multiple replicas of the Pod are running and can automatically restart if they fail.\n```yaml\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: example-deployment\n  labels:\n    app: example\nspec:\n  replicas: 3\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: example\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: example\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: example-container\n        image: nginx:1.17.1\n        ports:\n        - containerPort: 80\n\n```\n\n\n\n### Experiment result (2nd try)\nPassed unittests:\n- pre-unittest-example-pod-running\n- pre-unittest-example-service-availability\n- fault-unittest-example-pod-running\n- fault-unittest-example-service-availability\n- post-unittest-example-pod-running\n- post-unittest-example-service-availability\nFailed unittests:\n\n\nPlease elaborate the above summary of a Chaos Engineering Cycle.\nAI: ```json\n{\"summary\":"
            ],
            "{\"summary\":\"The Chaos Engineering cycle begins with understanding the user inputs, which include Kubernetes manifests for a Pod and a Service. The Pod manifest defines a single Nginx container with a restart policy of 'Never', and the Service manifest exposes this Pod on port 80. Two main resiliency issues are identified: the Pod's restart policy and the lack of redundancy due to a single Pod deployment.\\n\\nThe hypothesis for the experiment is that the system's steady states will be maintained even when faults are injected. Two steady states are defined: the Pod should be running at least 90% of the time, and the Service should have 99.9% availability with a response status of 200.\\n\\nThe fault scenario simulates a cyber attack using Chaos Mesh, injecting PodChaos to kill the Pod and NetworkChaos to introduce network latency. The experiment is divided into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation, each with specific tasks and durations to verify the system's behavior under stress.\\n\\nIn the first experiment attempt, the system fails to maintain the steady states during and after the fault injection. The Pod does not restart due to its 'Never' restart policy, and the Service becomes unavailable, confirming the identified issues. Recommendations include changing the Pod's restart policy and implementing a Deployment for redundancy.\\n\\nAfter modifying the system by replacing the Pod with a Deployment, the second experiment attempt is successful. All unit tests pass, indicating that the system maintains its steady states even when faults are injected, demonstrating improved resilience.\"}"
