User-input understanding\n### Here is the overview of user inputs:\nThe system consists of the following K8s manifest(s):K8s manifest: nginx/pod.yaml\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: example-pod\n  labels:\n    app: example\nspec:\n  restartPolicy: Never\n  containers:\n  - name: example-container\n    image: nginx:1.17.1\n    ports:\n    - containerPort: 80\n```\nSummary of nginx/pod.yaml:\n- This manifest defines a Kubernetes Pod.\n- The Pod is named 'example-pod'.\n- It includes metadata with a label 'app: example'.\n- The Pod's restart policy is set to 'Never', meaning it won't restart automatically if it fails.\n- The Pod contains one container named 'example-container'.\n- The container uses the 'nginx:1.17.1' image.\n- The container exposes port 80 for network traffic.\n\nK8s manifest: nginx/service.yaml\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: example-service\nspec:\n  selector:\n    app: example\n  ports:\n    - protocol: TCP\n      port: 80\n      targetPort: 80\n```\nSummary of nginx/service.yaml:\n- This manifest defines a Kubernetes Service.\n- The Service is named 'example-service'.\n- It uses a selector to target pods with the label 'app: example'.\n- The Service listens on port 80 using the TCP protocol.\n- Traffic received on port 80 is forwarded to the target port 80 on the selected pods.\n\nThe resiliency issues/weaknesses in the system are as follows:\nIssue #0: Pod Restart Policy\n  - details: The Pod will not restart automatically if it fails, which can lead to downtime.\n  - manifests having the issues: ['nginx/pod.yaml']\n  - problematic config: restartPolicy: Never\n\nIssue #1: Single Pod Deployment\n  - details: Deploying a single Pod without a controller like Deployment or ReplicaSet can lead to lack of redundancy and no automatic recovery from failures.\n  - manifests having the issues: ['nginx/pod.yaml']\n  - problematic config: kind: Pod\n\nThe expected type of application on the system (i.e., K8s manfests):\nThe service offers a web server application, likely serving static web content or acting as a reverse proxy for other services.; The given manifests define a Kubernetes Pod and a Service. The Pod is running an NGINX container, which is a popular web server and reverse proxy. The Service is set up to expose this Pod on port 80, which is the default port for HTTP traffic. The use of NGINX and the exposure of port 80 strongly suggest that the application is intended to serve web content or act as a web server. The file names and the use of NGINX further reinforce this assumption.\n\nChaos-Engineering instructions for the system are as follows: - The Chaos-Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute.\n\n## Step 1. Hypothesis definition\n### Here is the overview of the hypothesis for the system:\nThe hypothesis is \"The steady states of the sytem are maintained even when the fault scenario occurs (i.e., when the faults are injected)\".\nThe steady states here are as follows:\n2 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: example-pod-running\n- Description: The first steady state to define should be related to the Pod defined in 'nginx/pod.yaml', as it has the most immediate and critical issues: the Pod's restart policy is set to 'Never', and it is a single Pod deployment without redundancy. These issues can lead to downtime if the Pod fails. Therefore, a steady state should be defined to ensure that the Pod is running and available. A measurable output for this steady state is the number of running Pods, which should be exactly 1, as there is only one Pod defined in the manifest.\n- Threshold for the steady state: The pod should be in the 'Running' state at least 80% of the time during the check period.; The steady state we are considering is the 'example-pod' being in the 'Running' state. The current state shows that the pod was checked 5 times over a duration of 5 seconds, and it was running each time, resulting in a running count of 5. This indicates that the pod is consistently running without any downtime during the check period. To define a reasonable threshold, we need to account for potential minor fluctuations or delays in pod status updates. Therefore, a threshold that allows for a small tolerance would be appropriate. Given the current state, a threshold where the pod is running at least 80% of the time during the check period would be reasonable. This means that out of 5 checks, the pod should be running at least 4 times to satisfy the threshold, which aligns with the current state where it was running all 5 times.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestPodSteadyState(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n\n    def check_pod_status(self, namespace, pod_name):\n        try:\n            pod = self.v1.read_namespaced_pod(name=pod_name, namespace=namespace)\n            return pod.status.phase\n        except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n            print(f\"Exception when calling CoreV1Api->read_namespaced_pod: {e}\")\n            return None\n\n    def test_pod_running_state(self, duration):\n        namespace = 'default'\n        pod_name = 'example-pod'\n        running_count = 0\n\n        # Check the pod status every second for the specified duration\n        for _ in range(duration):\n            status = self.check_pod_status(namespace, pod_name)\n            if status == 'Running':\n                running_count += 1\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the running ratio\n        running_ratio = running_count / duration\n\n        # Assert that the pod is running at least 80% of the time\n        assert running_ratio >= 0.8, f\"Pod '{pod_name}' was not running at least 80% of the time. Running ratio: {running_ratio}\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test if the pod is running at least 80% of the time.')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=5, help='Duration to check the pod status in seconds')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    test = TestPodSteadyState()\n    test.test_pod_running_state(args.duration)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```2nd steady states:\n- Name: example-service-http-response-200\n- Description: The next steady state to consider should be related to the Service defined in 'nginx/service.yaml'. The Service is crucial for ensuring that the web server is accessible to clients. A potential issue with the Service could be related to its ability to route traffic correctly to the Pod. Therefore, a steady state should be defined to ensure that the Service is correctly routing traffic to the Pod. A measurable output for this steady state could be the Service's ability to respond to HTTP requests successfully. This can be measured by checking the HTTP response code, which should be 200 (OK) for successful requests.\n- Threshold for the steady state: At least 95% of HTTP requests should return a status code 200.; The steady state we are considering is the ability of the 'example-service' to respond with HTTP status code 200, indicating successful handling of requests. The k6 test results show that 100% of the requests received a status 200 response, which is the desired outcome. To account for potential fluctuations in a real-world scenario, we should set a threshold that allows for a small percentage of requests to fail while still considering the system to be in a steady state. A reasonable threshold would be to expect at least 95% of the requests to return a status 200, allowing for some minor network issues or transient errors.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following K6 Javascript:\n```\nimport http from 'k6/http';\nimport { check } from 'k6';\n\nexport const options = {\n  vus: 5,\n  duration: '5s',\n  thresholds: {\n    // Adding a threshold to ensure that at least 95% of requests return a status code 200\n    'http_req_failed': ['rate<0.05'], // Less than 5% of requests should fail\n  },\n};\n\nexport default function () {\n  const res = http.get('http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:80');\n  check(res, {\n    'is status 200': (r) => r.status === 200,\n  });\n}\n```\n\nThe fault scenario here is as follows:\n\nAn assumed fault scenario is as follows:\n- Event: Cyber Attack\n- Used Chaos Engineering tool: Chaos Mesh\n- Faults to simulate the event: [[Fault(name='PodChaos', name_id=0, params={'action': 'pod-kill', 'mode': 'one', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}, 'value': '1'})], [Fault(name='NetworkChaos', name_id=1, params={'action': 'delay', 'direction': 'to', 'target': {'mode': 'all', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}}, 'mode': 'all', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}, 'device': 'eth0', 'delay': {'latency': '100ms', 'jitter': '10ms', 'correlation': '50'}})]]\n- Description: Given the system's weaknesses, a cyber attack targeting the web server could be highly impactful. The system's main vulnerabilities are the single Pod deployment without redundancy and the Pod's restart policy set to 'Never'. These issues can lead to downtime if the Pod fails, affecting the steady state of the system. To simulate a cyber attack, we can inject faults that exploit these weaknesses. First, we can use PodChaos to simulate a Pod failure, which will test the system's ability to maintain the 'example-pod-running' steady state. Since the Pod won't restart automatically, this will likely cause downtime. Next, we can use NetworkChaos to simulate network latency, which will test the 'example-service-http-response-200' steady state by affecting the Service's ability to route traffic correctly. This sequence simulates a cyber attack by first taking down the Pod and then degrading the network performance, which could happen during a coordinated attack.\n\n## Step 2.1. Chaos-Engineering experiment\n### Here is the overview of my Chaos-Engineering experiment to verify the hypothesis:\nThe entire time schedule of the Chaos-Engineering experiment is as follows (The experiment is divided into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation phases):\nGiven the constraints and the nature of the system, we need to design a Chaos Engineering experiment that fits within a 1-minute timeframe. The experiment is divided into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation. The pre-validation phase ensures that the system is in a steady state before we introduce any faults. The fault-injection phase is where we introduce the faults to observe the system's behavior under stress. Finally, the post-validation phase checks if the system returns to its steady state after the faults are removed. \n\nConsidering the time constraint, we need to allocate time efficiently across these phases. The pre-validation phase should be short but sufficient to confirm the system's steady state. Given the steady states defined, we can allocate 10 seconds for pre-validation to check both the pod's running state and the service's HTTP response. The fault-injection phase is the core of the experiment, where we simulate the cyber attack by introducing PodChaos and NetworkChaos. We should allocate the majority of the time here, around 40 seconds, to observe the system's behavior under these conditions. Finally, the post-validation phase should be long enough to ensure the system returns to its steady state, so we allocate 10 seconds for this phase. This allocation ensures that we have a balanced approach to validating the system's resilience within the 1-minute constraint.\n- Total experiment phase: 1m\n- Pre-validation phase: 10s\n- Fault-injection phase: 40s\n- Post-validation phase: 10s\n\nThe details of the three phases are as follows:\nPre-validation Phase (10s):\nIn the pre-validation phase, we need to ensure that the system is in its expected steady states before we proceed with fault injection. Given the two steady states defined, we will perform unit tests to verify each of them. The first steady state, 'example-pod-running', requires checking that the pod is running at least 80% of the time. The second steady state, 'example-service-http-response-200', requires verifying that at least 95% of HTTP requests return a status code 200. Since the total time for the pre-validation phase is 10 seconds, we will allocate 5 seconds for each unit test. These tests will be executed sequentially to ensure that each steady state is independently verified before moving to the fault injection phase. This approach ensures that we have a clear baseline of the system's behavior under normal conditions, which is crucial for comparing against the system's behavior during and after fault injection.\n\nFault-injection Phase (40s):\nIn this fault-injection phase, we aim to simulate a cyber attack by injecting two types of faults: PodChaos and NetworkChaos. The total duration for this phase is 40 seconds, so we need to carefully schedule the faults and unit tests to fit within this timeframe. \n\nFirst, we will inject the PodChaos fault to simulate a Pod failure. This will test the system's ability to maintain the 'example-pod-running' steady state. Since the Pod's restart policy is set to 'Never', this fault will likely cause downtime, directly impacting the first steady state. We will start this fault at the beginning of the phase (grace period of 0s) and let it run for 20 seconds. \n\nSimultaneously, we will run the unit test for the 'example-pod-running' steady state to observe the impact of the PodChaos fault. This test will also start at 0s and run for 20 seconds, allowing us to verify if the Pod remains in the 'Running' state at least 80% of the time during the fault.\n\nNext, we will inject the NetworkChaos fault to simulate network latency. This will test the 'example-service-http-response-200' steady state by affecting the Service's ability to route traffic correctly. We will start this fault at 20 seconds (grace period of 20s) and let it run for the remaining 20 seconds of the phase.\n\nSimultaneously, we will run the unit test for the 'example-service-http-response-200' steady state to observe the impact of the NetworkChaos fault. This test will also start at 20 seconds and run for 20 seconds, allowing us to verify if the Service can still respond with HTTP status code 200 for at least 95% of the requests during the fault.\n\nBy staggering the faults and unit tests in this manner, we can effectively observe the system's behavior under each fault condition and ensure that the entire fault-injection phase is completed within the 40-second limit.\n\nPost-validation Phase (10s):\nIn the post-validation phase, we need to ensure that the system has returned to its steady states after the fault injection. Given the 10-second time constraint, we will perform quick checks to verify each steady state. The first steady state, 'example-pod-running', requires the pod to be in the 'Running' state at least 80% of the time. We will check the pod status every second for 5 seconds, allowing a 1-second grace period for the system to stabilize after the fault injection. The second steady state, 'example-service-http-response-200', requires at least 95% of HTTP requests to return a status code 200. We will perform a quick HTTP request test for 5 seconds, also allowing a 1-second grace period. These tests will be executed sequentially to ensure that each steady state is verified independently, and the system has enough time to recover from the faults.\n\nThe summary of the above experiment plan:\nThe Chaos Engineering experiment is structured into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation, all within a 1-minute timeframe. \n\nIn the pre-validation phase, which lasts for 10 seconds, two unit tests are conducted sequentially to ensure the system is in a steady state. The first test, 'example-pod-running', is executed immediately at the start of the phase and runs for 5 seconds. This test checks if the pod is running at least 80% of the time. Following this, the second test, 'example-service-http-response-200', begins at the 5-second mark and also runs for 5 seconds, verifying that at least 95% of HTTP requests return a status code 200.\n\nThe fault-injection phase spans 40 seconds and involves two types of fault injections: PodChaos and NetworkChaos. The PodChaos fault is injected at the start of the phase and runs for 20 seconds, simulating a Pod failure. Concurrently, a unit test for 'example-pod-running' is conducted to assess the impact of this fault. At the 20-second mark, the NetworkChaos fault is introduced, running for the remaining 20 seconds to simulate network latency. Simultaneously, a unit test for 'example-service-http-response-200' is performed to evaluate the service's response under network stress.\n\nFinally, the post-validation phase, lasting 10 seconds, verifies the system's return to steady states. The 'example-pod-running' test starts after a 1-second grace period and runs for 5 seconds, checking the pod's status. Subsequently, the 'example-service-http-response-200' test begins after another 1-second grace period and runs for 5 seconds, ensuring the service's HTTP response rate is restored. These tests are executed sequentially to confirm the system's recovery from the injected faults.\n\nTo automatically conduct the above experiment plan with Chaos Mesh, the following Chaos-Mesh-Worfklow file was created (by applying it to the cluster, the experiment plan will be automatically executed according to the Chaos-Mesh-Worfklow file):\n```yaml\napiVersion: chaos-mesh.org/v1alpha1\nkind: Workflow\nmetadata:\n  name: chaos-experiment-20241124-133945\nspec:\n  entry: the-entry\n  templates:\n    #-------------------------------\n    # entry point of whole workflow\n    #-------------------------------\n    -

Here's a detailed analysis of the failures observed during the experiment:\n\n1. **Fault-Unittest-Example-Pod-Running Failure:**\n   - **Cause:** The failure of the 'example-pod-running' test during the fault-injection phase is directly linked to the PodChaos fault, which simulates a Pod failure. The Pod's restart policy is set to 'Never', as specified in the `nginx/pod.yaml` manifest. This configuration means that once the Pod is killed, it does not automatically restart, leading to a 404 error when attempting to read the Pod's status. The running ratio of 0.0 confirms that the Pod was not running at all during the test period.\n   - **Insight:** The lack of a restart mechanism for the Pod is a significant vulnerability. In a real-world scenario, any failure of the Pod would result in downtime, as there is no redundancy or automatic recovery.\n   - **Recommendation:** To improve resilience, consider using a Deployment or ReplicaSet instead of a standalone Pod. This would provide redundancy and ensure that Pods are automatically restarted in case of failure.\n\n2. **Fault-Unittest-Example-Service-Http-Response-200 Failure:**\n   - **Cause:** The failure of the 'example-service-http-response-200' test during the fault-injection phase is due to the Pod being unavailable, as indicated by the 'connection refused' errors. Since the Service relies on the Pod to handle HTTP requests, the unavailability of the Pod results in the Service being unable to fulfill requests, leading to a failure in meeting the 95% success threshold.\n   - **Insight:** The Service's dependency on a single Pod without redundancy means that any Pod failure directly impacts the Service's ability to function, leading to a complete service outage.\n   - **Recommendation:** Implementing a Deployment with multiple replicas would ensure that the Service can continue to route traffic to available Pods, even if one Pod fails.\n\n3. **Post-Unittest Failures:**\n   - **Cause:** The failures in the post-validation phase for both 'example-pod-running' and 'example-service-http-response-200' tests indicate that the system did not recover from the injected faults. The Pod remained unavailable, and consequently, the Service continued to fail in handling requests.\n   - **Insight:** The system's inability to recover post-fault injection highlights the critical need for automatic recovery mechanisms and redundancy.\n   - **Recommendation:** In addition to using Deployments for redundancy, consider implementing health checks and readiness probes to ensure that Pods are healthy and ready to serve traffic. This would help in automatically replacing unhealthy Pods and maintaining service availability.\n\nOverall, the experiment underscores the importance of addressing the identified weaknesses in the system's configuration, particularly the single Pod deployment and its restart policy. By adopting Kubernetes best practices such as using Deployments and ensuring redundancy, the system's resilience to faults can be significantly improved.\n\n### Improvement result (1st try)\n1 K8s manifests are modified:\n- The K8s manifest 'nginx/pod.yaml' was replaced.\nReplace the standalone Pod with a Deployment to provide redundancy and automatic recovery. This change addresses the issues of the Pod's restart policy being set to 'Never' and the lack of redundancy in a single Pod deployment.\n```yaml\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: example-deployment\n  labels:\n    app: example\nspec:\n  replicas: 3\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: example\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: example\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: example-container\n        image: nginx:1.17.1\n        ports:\n        - containerPort: 80\n```\n\n\n\n### Experiment result (2nd try)\nPassed unittests:\n- pre-unittest-example-pod-running\n- pre-unittest-example-service-http-response-200\n- fault-unittest-example-pod-running\n- fault-unittest-example-service-http-response-200\n- post-unittest-example-pod-running\n- post-unittest-example-service-http-response-200\nFailed unittests:\n\n\nPlease elaborate the above summary of a Chaos Engineering Cycle.\nAI: ```json\n{\"summary\":"
            ],
            "{\"summary\":\"The Chaos Engineering cycle involves a detailed process to test the resilience of a Kubernetes-based system, specifically focusing on a web server application using NGINX. The cycle begins with understanding the user inputs, which include Kubernetes manifests for a Pod and a Service. The Pod manifest defines a single Pod with a 'Never' restart policy, which poses a risk of downtime if the Pod fails. The Service manifest exposes the Pod on port 80, but relies on the Pod's availability to function correctly.\\n\\nThe identified resiliency issues include the Pod's restart policy and the lack of redundancy due to a single Pod deployment. The hypothesis for the experiment is that the system should maintain its steady states even when faults are injected. Two steady states are defined: the Pod should be running at least 80% of the time, and the Service should respond with HTTP status code 200 for at least 95% of requests.\\n\\nThe experiment is structured into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation, all within a 1-minute timeframe. The pre-validation phase checks the system's steady states before fault injection. The fault-injection phase simulates a cyber attack using Chaos Mesh, introducing PodChaos to kill the Pod and NetworkChaos to delay network traffic. The post-validation phase verifies if the system returns to its steady states after the faults are removed.\\n\\nThe first experiment attempt revealed critical issues: the Pod did not restart after being killed, and the Service failed to handle requests due to the Pod's unavailability. These failures highlighted the need for redundancy and automatic recovery mechanisms. The recommendation was to replace the standalone Pod with a Deployment, providing multiple replicas for redundancy and automatic recovery.\\n\\nAfter implementing the recommended changes, the second experiment attempt was successful, with all unit tests passing. The Deployment ensured that the system maintained its steady states even during fault injection, demonstrating improved resilience. This cycle underscores the importance of using Kubernetes best practices, such as Deployments, to enhance system reliability and fault tolerance.\"}"
