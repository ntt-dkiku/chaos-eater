The Pod is running an NGINX container, which is a popular web server and reverse proxy. The Service is set up to expose this Pod on port 80, which is the default port for HTTP traffic. The use of NGINX and the exposure of port 80 strongly suggest that the application is intended to serve web content or act as a web server. The file names and the use of NGINX further reinforce this assumption.\n\n# Here is the hypothesis for my system:\nThe hypothesis is \"The steady states of the sytem are maintained even when the fault scenario occurs (i.e., when the faults are injected)\".\nThe steady states here are as follows:\n2 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: example-pod-running\n- Description: The first steady state to define should be related to the Pod defined in 'nginx/pod.yaml', as it has the most immediate and critical issues: the Pod's restart policy is set to 'Never', and it is a single Pod deployment without redundancy. These issues can lead to downtime if the Pod fails. Therefore, a steady state should be defined to ensure that the Pod is running and available. A measurable output for this steady state is the number of running Pods, which should be exactly 1, as there is only one Pod defined in the manifest.\n- Threshold for the steady state: The pod should be in the 'Running' state at least 80% of the time during the check period.; The steady state we are considering is the 'example-pod' being in the 'Running' state. The current state shows that the pod was checked 5 times over a duration of 5 seconds, and it was running each time, resulting in a running count of 5. This indicates that the pod is consistently running without any downtime during the check period. To define a reasonable threshold, we need to account for potential minor fluctuations or delays in pod status updates. Therefore, a threshold that allows for a small tolerance would be appropriate. Given the current state, a threshold where the pod is running at least 80% of the time during the check period would be reasonable. This means that out of 5 checks, the pod should be running at least 4 times to satisfy the threshold, which aligns with the current state where it was running all 5 times.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestPodSteadyState(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n\n    def check_pod_status(self, namespace, pod_name):\n        try:\n            pod = self.v1.read_namespaced_pod(name=pod_name, namespace=namespace)\n            return pod.status.phase\n        except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n            print(f\"Exception when calling CoreV1Api->read_namespaced_pod: {e}\")\n            return None\n\n    def test_pod_running_state(self, duration):\n        namespace = 'default'\n        pod_name = 'example-pod'\n        running_count = 0\n\n        # Check the pod status every second for the specified duration\n        for _ in range(duration):\n            status = self.check_pod_status(namespace, pod_name)\n            if status == 'Running':\n                running_count += 1\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the running ratio\n        running_ratio = running_count / duration\n\n        # Assert that the pod is running at least 80% of the time\n        assert running_ratio >= 0.8, f\"Pod '{pod_name}' was not running at least 80% of the time. Running ratio: {running_ratio}\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test if the pod is running at least 80% of the time.')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=5, help='Duration to check the pod status in seconds')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    test = TestPodSteadyState()\n    test.test_pod_running_state(args.duration)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```2nd steady states:\n- Name: example-service-http-response-200\n- Description: The next steady state to consider should be related to the Service defined in 'nginx/service.yaml'. The Service is crucial for ensuring that the web server is accessible to clients. A potential issue with the Service could be related to its ability to route traffic correctly to the Pod. Therefore, a steady state should be defined to ensure that the Service is correctly routing traffic to the Pod. A measurable output for this steady state could be the Service's ability to respond to HTTP requests successfully. This can be measured by checking the HTTP response code, which should be 200 (OK) for successful requests.\n- Threshold for the steady state: At least 95% of HTTP requests should return a status code 200.; The steady state we are considering is the ability of the 'example-service' to respond with HTTP status code 200, indicating successful handling of requests. The k6 test results show that 100% of the requests received a status 200 response, which is the desired outcome. To account for potential fluctuations in a real-world scenario, we should set a threshold that allows for a small percentage of requests to fail while still considering the system to be in a steady state. A reasonable threshold would be to expect at least 95% of the requests to return a status 200, allowing for some minor network issues or transient errors.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following K6 Javascript:\n```\nimport http from 'k6/http';\nimport { check } from 'k6';\n\nexport const options = {\n  vus: 5,\n  duration: '5s',\n  thresholds: {\n    // Adding a threshold to ensure that at least 95% of requests return a status code 200\n    'http_req_failed': ['rate<0.05'], // Less than 5% of requests should fail\n  },\n};\n\nexport default function () {\n  const res = http.get('http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:80');\n  check(res, {\n    'is status 200': (r) => r.status === 200,\n  });\n}\n```\n\nThe fault scenario here is as follows:\n\nAn assumed fault scenario is as follows:\n- Event: Cyber Attack\n- Used Chaos Engineering tool: Chaos Mesh\n- Faults to simulate the event: [[Fault(name='PodChaos', name_id=0, params={'action': 'pod-kill', 'mode': 'one', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}, 'value': '1'})], [Fault(name='NetworkChaos', name_id=1, params={'action': 'delay', 'direction': 'to', 'target': {'mode': 'all', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}}, 'mode': 'all', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}, 'device': 'eth0', 'delay': {'latency': '100ms', 'jitter': '10ms', 'correlation': '50'}})]]\n- Description: Given the system's weaknesses, a cyber attack targeting the web server could be highly impactful. The system's main vulnerabilities are the single Pod deployment without redundancy and the Pod's restart policy set to 'Never'. These issues can lead to downtime if the Pod fails, affecting the steady state of the system. To simulate a cyber attack, we can inject faults that exploit these weaknesses. First, we can use PodChaos to simulate a Pod failure, which will test the system's ability to maintain the 'example-pod-running' steady state. Since the Pod won't restart automatically, this will likely cause downtime. Next, we can use NetworkChaos to simulate network latency, which will test the 'example-service-http-response-200' steady state by affecting the Service's ability to route traffic correctly. This sequence simulates a cyber attack by first taking down the Pod and then degrading the network performance, which could happen during a coordinated attack.\n\n# Here is the overview of my Chaos-Engineering experiment to verify the hypothesis:\nThe Chaos Engineering experiment is structured into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation, all within a 1-minute timeframe. \n\nIn the pre-validation phase, which lasts for 10 seconds, two unit tests are conducted sequentially to ensure the system is in a steady state. The first test, 'example-pod-running', is executed immediately at the start of the phase and runs for 5 seconds. This test checks if the pod is running at least 80% of the time. Following this, the second test, 'example-service-http-response-200', begins at the 5-second mark and also runs for 5 seconds, verifying that at least 95% of HTTP requests return a status code 200.\n\nThe fault-injection phase spans 40 seconds and involves two types of fault injections: PodChaos and NetworkChaos. The PodChaos fault is injected at the start of the phase and runs for 20 seconds, simulating a Pod failure. Concurrently, a unit test for 'example-pod-running' is conducted to assess the impact of this fault. At the 20-second mark, the NetworkChaos fault is introduced, running for the remaining 20 seconds to simulate network latency. Simultaneously, a unit test for 'example-service-http-response-200' is performed to evaluate the service's response under network stress.\n\nFinally, the post-validation phase, lasting 10 seconds, verifies the system's return to steady states. The 'example-pod-running' test starts after a 1-second grace period and runs for 5 seconds, checking the pod's status. Subsequently, the 'example-service-http-response-200' test begins after another 1-second grace period and runs for 5 seconds, ensuring the service's HTTP response rate is restored. These tests are executed sequentially to confirm the system's recovery from the injected faults.\n\n# The experiment's results of the original system are as follows:\nPassed unittests:\n- pre-unittest-example-pod-running\n- pre-unittest-example-service-http-response-200\nFailed unittests:\n- fault-unittest-example-pod-running\n```log\nException when calling CoreV1Api->read_namespaced_pod: (404)\nReason: Not Found\nHTTP response headers: HTTPHeaderDict({'Audit-Id': '68a3d2cf-6466-4474-ac5b-a51a22dd0401', 'Cache-Control': 'no-cache, private', 'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'X-Kubernetes-Pf-Flowschema-Uid': 'c4624bd9-7fc7-42c6-bcb8-4235110a860d', 'X-Kubernetes-Pf-Prioritylevel-Uid': '4706085f-6263-43ae-93f5-b4a61de8b6be', 'Date': 'Sun, 24 Nov 2024 13:35:50 GMT', 'Content-Length': '190'})\nHTTP response body: {\"kind\":\"Status\"...example-pod-running_mod0.py\", line 35, in test_pod_running_state\n    assert running_ratio >= 0.8, f\"Pod '{pod_name}' was not running at least 80% of the time.

Here's a detailed analysis of the failures observed during the experiment:\n\n1. **Fault-Unittest-Example-Pod-Running Failure:**\n   - **Cause:** The failure of the 'example-pod-running' test during the fault-injection phase is directly linked to the PodChaos fault, which simulates a Pod failure. The Pod's restart policy is set to 'Never', as specified in the `nginx/pod.yaml` manifest. This configuration means that once the Pod is killed, it does not automatically restart, leading to a 404 error when attempting to read the Pod's status. The running ratio of 0.0 confirms that the Pod was not running at all during the test period.\n   - **Insight:** The lack of a restart mechanism for the Pod is a significant vulnerability. In a real-world scenario, any failure of the Pod would result in downtime, as there is no redundancy or automatic recovery.\n   - **Recommendation:** To improve resilience, consider using a Deployment or ReplicaSet instead of a standalone Pod. This would provide redundancy and ensure that Pods are automatically restarted in case of failure.\n\n2. **Fault-Unittest-Example-Service-Http-Response-200 Failure:**\n   - **Cause:** The failure of the 'example-service-http-response-200' test during the fault-injection phase is due to the Pod being unavailable, as indicated by the 'connection refused' errors. Since the Service relies on the Pod to handle HTTP requests, the unavailability of the Pod results in the Service being unable to fulfill requests, leading to a failure in meeting the 95% success threshold.\n   - **Insight:** The Service's dependency on a single Pod without redundancy means that any Pod failure directly impacts the Service's ability to function, leading to a complete service outage.\n   - **Recommendation:** Implementing a Deployment with multiple replicas would ensure that the Service can continue to route traffic to available Pods, even if one Pod fails.\n\n3. **Post-Unittest Failures:**\n   - **Cause:** The failures in the post-validation phase for both 'example-pod-running' and 'example-service-http-response-200' tests indicate that the system did not recover from the injected faults. The Pod remained unavailable, and consequently, the Service continued to fail in handling requests.\n   - **Insight:** The system's inability to recover post-fault injection highlights the critical need for automatic recovery mechanisms and redundancy.\n   - **Recommendation:** In addition to using Deployments for redundancy, consider implementing health checks and readiness probes to ensure that Pods are healthy and ready to serve traffic. This would help in automatically replacing unhealthy Pods and maintaining service availability.\n\nOverall, the experiment underscores the importance of addressing the identified weaknesses in the system's configuration, particularly the single Pod deployment and its restart policy. By adopting Kubernetes best practices such as using Deployments and ensuring redundancy, the system's resilience to faults can be significantly improved.\nHuman: Then, please reconfigure the system to avoid the fails (improve resiliency).\nAI: ```json\n{\"thought\":"
