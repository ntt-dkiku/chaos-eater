    "description": "Given the system's weaknesses, a cyber attack targeting the web server could be highly impactful. The system's main vulnerabilities are the single Pod deployment without redundancy and the Pod's restart policy set to 'Never'. These issues can lead to downtime if the Pod fails, affecting the steady state of the system. To simulate a cyber attack, we can inject faults that exploit these weaknesses. First, we can use PodChaos to simulate a Pod failure, which will test the system's ability to maintain the 'example-pod-running' steady state. Since the Pod won't restart automatically, this will likely cause downtime. Next, we can use NetworkChaos to simulate network latency, which will test the 'example-service-http-response-200' steady state by affecting the Service's ability to route traffic correctly. This sequence simulates a cyber attack by first taking down the Pod and then degrading the network performance, which could happen during a coordinated attack."
