These issues can lead to downtime if the Pod fails. Therefore, a steady state should be defined to ensure that the Pod is running and available. A measurable output for this steady state is the number of running Pods, which should be exactly 1, as there is only one Pod defined in the manifest.\n\nThe steady state was inspected with the following python code of k8s client libraries:\nimport os\nimport time\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\n\ndef check_pod_status(namespace, pod_name):\n    # Load Kubernetes configuration based on the environment\n    if os.getenv('KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST'):\n        config.load_incluster_config()\n    else:\n        config.load_kube_config()\n\n    v1 = client.CoreV1Api()\n    try:\n        pod = v1.read_namespaced_pod(name=pod_name, namespace=namespace)\n        return pod.status.phase\n    except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n        print(f\"Exception when calling CoreV1Api->read_namespaced_pod: {e}\")\n        return None\n\ndef main(duration):\n    namespace = 'default'\n    pod_name = 'example-pod'\n    running_count = 0\n    for _ in range(duration):\n        status = check_pod_status(namespace, pod_name)\n        if status == 'Running':\n            running_count += 1\n        time.sleep(1)\n    print(f\"Pod '{pod_name}' running status checked {duration} times, running count: {running_count}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    import argparse\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Check if the pod is running.')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=5, help='Duration to check the pod status in seconds')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n    main(args.duration)\n\nThe threshold of the steady state: The pod should be in the 'Running' state at least 80% of the time during the check period.; The steady state we are considering is the 'example-pod' being in the 'Running' state. The current state shows that the pod was checked 5 times over a duration of 5 seconds, and it was running each time, resulting in a running count of 5. This indicates that the pod is consistently running without any downtime during the check period. To define a reasonable threshold, we need to account for potential minor fluctuations or delays in pod status updates. Therefore, a threshold that allows for a small tolerance would be appropriate. Given the current state, a threshold where the pod is running at least 80% of the time during the check period would be reasonable. This means that out of 5 checks, the pod should be running at least 4 times to satisfy the threshold, which aligns with the current state where it was running all 5 times.\n\nGiven the above steady state, command, and threshold, please write a Python unit test to check if the steady state satisfies the threshold.\nThe threshold in the unit test must exactly match the threshold defined above. Implement it to support variable durations. Use a representative value (e.g., percentage, ratio, etc.) for the threshold.

The Pod is running an NGINX container, which is a popular web server and reverse proxy. The Service is set up to expose this Pod on port 80, which is the default port for HTTP traffic. The use of NGINX and the exposure of port 80 strongly suggest that the application is intended to serve web content or act as a web server. The file names and the use of NGINX further reinforce this assumption.\n\n# You will determine a reasonable threshold for the following steady state of my system:\nexample-service-http-response-200: The next steady state to consider should be related to the Service defined in 'nginx/service.yaml'.
