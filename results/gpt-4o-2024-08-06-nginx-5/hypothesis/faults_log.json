The supported subtypes include 'pod-failure', 'pod-kill', 'container-kill'.\n- NetworkChaos: simulates network failures, such as network latency, packet loss, packet disorder, and network partitions.\n- DNSChaos: simulates DNS failures, such as the parsing failure of DNS domain name and the wrong IP address returned.\n- HTTPChaos: simulates HTTP communication failures, such as HTTP communication latency.\n- StressChaos: simulates CPU race or memory race.\n- IOChaos: simulates the I/O failure of an application file, such as I/O delays, read and write failures.\n- TimeChaos: simulates the time jump exception.\n\n- The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema.

The Pod is running an NGINX container, which is a popular web server and reverse proxy. The Service is set up to expose this Pod on port 80, which is the default port for HTTP traffic. The use of NGINX and the exposure of port 80 strongly suggest that the application is intended to serve web content or act as a web server. The file names and the use of NGINX further reinforce this assumption.\n\nSteady states of the network system defined by the manifests are the following:\n2 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: example-pod-running\n- Description: The first steady state to define should be related to the Pod defined in 'nginx/pod.yaml', as it has the most immediate and critical issues: the Pod's restart policy is set to 'Never', and it is a single Pod deployment without redundancy. These issues can lead to downtime if the Pod fails. Therefore, a steady state should be defined to ensure that the Pod is running and available. A measurable output for this steady state is the number of running Pods, which should be exactly 1, as there is only one Pod defined in the manifest.\n- Threshold for the steady state: The pod should be in the 'Running' state at least 80% of the time during the check period.; The steady state we are considering is the 'example-pod' being in the 'Running' state. The current state shows that the pod was checked 5 times over a duration of 5 seconds, and it was running each time, resulting in a running count of 5. This indicates that the pod is consistently running without any downtime during the check period. To define a reasonable threshold, we need to account for potential minor fluctuations or delays in pod status updates. Therefore, a threshold that allows for a small tolerance would be appropriate. Given the current state, a threshold where the pod is running at least 80% of the time during the check period would be reasonable. This means that out of 5 checks, the pod should be running at least 4 times to satisfy the threshold, which aligns with the current state where it was running all 5 times.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestPodSteadyState(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n\n    def check_pod_status(self, namespace, pod_name):\n        try:\n            pod = self.v1.read_namespaced_pod(name=pod_name, namespace=namespace)\n            return pod.status.phase\n        except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n            print(f\"Exception when calling CoreV1Api->read_namespaced_pod: {e}\")\n            return None\n\n    def test_pod_running_state(self, duration):\n        namespace = 'default'\n        pod_name = 'example-pod'\n        running_count = 0\n\n        # Check the pod status every second for the specified duration\n        for _ in range(duration):\n            status = self.check_pod_status(namespace, pod_name)\n            if status == 'Running':\n                running_count += 1\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the running ratio\n        running_ratio = running_count / duration\n\n        # Assert that the pod is running at least 80% of the time\n        assert running_ratio >= 0.8, f\"Pod '{pod_name}' was not running at least 80% of the time.

The Service is crucial for ensuring that the web server is accessible to clients. A potential issue with the Service could be related to its ability to route traffic correctly to the Pod. Therefore, a steady state should be defined to ensure that the Service is correctly routing traffic to the Pod. A measurable output for this steady state could be the Service's ability to respond to HTTP requests successfully. This can be measured by checking the HTTP response code, which should be 200 (OK) for successful requests.\n- Threshold for the steady state: At least 95% of HTTP requests should return a status code 200.; The steady state we are considering is the ability of the 'example-service' to respond with HTTP status code 200, indicating successful handling of requests. The k6 test results show that 100% of the requests received a status 200 response, which is the desired outcome. To account for potential fluctuations in a real-world scenario, we should set a threshold that allows for a small percentage of requests to fail while still considering the system to be in a steady state. A reasonable threshold would be to expect at least 95% of the requests to return a status 200, allowing for some minor network issues or transient errors.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following K6 Javascript:\n```\nimport http from 'k6/http';\nimport { check } from 'k6';\n\nexport const options = {\n  vus: 5,\n  duration: '5s',\n  thresholds: {\n    // Adding a threshold to ensure that at least 95% of requests return a status code 200\n    'http_req_failed': ['rate<0.05'], // Less than 5% of requests should fail\n  },\n};\n\nexport default function () {\n  const res = http.get('http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:80');\n  check(res, {\n    'is status 200': (r) => r.status === 200,\n  });\n}\n```\n\nPlease follow the instructions below regarding Chaos Engineering as necessary:\n- The Chaos-Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute.\n\nNow, please define fault injections to reveal the system's vulnerabilities.\nAI: ```json\n{\"event\":"

                "System: You are a helpful AI assistant for Chaos Engineering.\nGiven k8s manifests that defines a network system, its steady states, and a fault type that may affect the steady states in the system, please detail the parameters of the fault.\nAlways keep the following rules:\n- Pay attention to namespace specification. If the namespace is specified in the manifest, it is deployed with the namespace. If not, it is deployed with the 'default' namespace.\n- The parameters follow the format of Chaos Mesh.\nHuman: Here is the overview of my system:\nThe system consists of the following K8s manifest(s):K8s manifest: nginx/pod.yaml\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: example-pod\n  labels:\n    app: example\nspec:\n  restartPolicy: Never\n  containers:\n  - name: example-container\n    image: nginx:1.17.1\n    ports:\n    - containerPort: 80\n```\nSummary of nginx/pod.yaml:\n- This manifest defines a Kubernetes Pod.\n- The Pod is named 'example-pod'.\n- It includes metadata with a label 'app: example'.\n- The Pod's restart policy is set to 'Never', meaning it won't restart automatically if it fails.\n- The Pod contains one container named 'example-container'.\n- The container uses the 'nginx:1.17.1' image.\n- The container exposes port 80 for network traffic.\n\nK8s manifest: nginx/service.yaml\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: example-service\nspec:\n  selector:\n    app: example\n  ports:\n    - protocol: TCP\n      port: 80\n      targetPort: 80\n```\nSummary of nginx/service.yaml:\n- This manifest defines a Kubernetes Service.\n- The Service is named 'example-service'.\n- It uses a selector to target pods with the label 'app: example'.\n- The Service listens on port 80 using the TCP protocol.\n- Traffic received on port 80 is forwarded to the target port 80 on the selected pods.\n\nThe resiliency issues/weaknesses in the system are as follows:\nIssue #0: Pod Restart Policy\n  - details: The Pod will not restart automatically if it fails, which can lead to downtime.\n  - manifests having the issues: ['nginx/pod.yaml']\n  - problematic config: restartPolicy: Never\n\nIssue #1: Single Pod Deployment\n  - details: Deploying a single Pod without a controller like Deployment or ReplicaSet can lead to lack of redundancy and no automatic recovery from failures.\n  - manifests having the issues: ['nginx/pod.yaml']\n  - problematic config: kind: Pod\n\nThe expected type of application on the system (i.e., K8s manfests):\nThe service offers a web server application, likely serving static web content or acting as a reverse proxy for other services.; The given manifests define a Kubernetes Pod and a Service. The Pod is running an NGINX container, which is a popular web server and reverse proxy. The Service is set up to expose this Pod on port 80, which is the default port for HTTP traffic. The use of NGINX and the exposure of port 80 strongly suggest that the application is intended to serve web content or act as a web server. The file names and the use of NGINX further reinforce this assumption.\n\nSteady states of my system:\n2 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: example-pod-running\n- Description: The first steady state to define should be related to the Pod defined in 'nginx/pod.yaml', as it has the most immediate and critical issues: the Pod's restart policy is set to 'Never', and it is a single Pod deployment without redundancy. These issues can lead to downtime if the Pod fails. Therefore, a steady state should be defined to ensure that the Pod is running and available. A measurable output for this steady state is the number of running Pods, which should be exactly 1, as there is only one Pod defined in the manifest.\n- Threshold for the steady state: The pod should be in the 'Running' state at least 80% of the time during the check period.; The steady state we are considering is the 'example-pod' being in the 'Running' state. The current state shows that the pod was checked 5 times over a duration of 5 seconds, and it was running each time, resulting in a running count of 5. This indicates that the pod is consistently running without any downtime during the check period. To define a reasonable threshold, we need to account for potential minor fluctuations or delays in pod status updates. Therefore, a threshold that allows for a small tolerance would be appropriate. Given the current state, a threshold where the pod is running at least 80% of the time during the check period would be reasonable. This means that out of 5 checks, the pod should be running at least 4 times to satisfy the threshold, which aligns with the current state where it was running all 5 times.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestPodSteadyState(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n\n    def check_pod_status(self, namespace, pod_name):\n        try:\n            pod = self.v1.read_namespaced_pod(name=pod_name, namespace=namespace)\n            return pod.status.phase\n        except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n            print(f\"Exception when calling CoreV1Api->read_namespaced_pod: {e}\")\n            return None\n\n    def test_pod_running_state(self, duration):\n        namespace = 'default'\n        pod_name = 'example-pod'\n        running_count = 0\n\n        # Check the pod status every second for the specified duration\n        for _ in range(duration):\n            status = self.check_pod_status(namespace, pod_name)\n            if status == 'Running':\n                running_count += 1\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the running ratio\n        running_ratio = running_count / duration\n\n        # Assert that the pod is running at least 80% of the time\n        assert running_ratio >= 0.8, f\"Pod '{pod_name}' was not running at least 80% of the time. Running ratio: {running_ratio}\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test if the pod is running at least 80% of the time.')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=5, help='Duration to check the pod status in seconds')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    test = TestPodSteadyState()\n    test.test_pod_running_state(args.duration)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```2nd steady states:\n- Name: example-service-http-response-200\n- Description: The next steady state to consider should be related to the Service defined in 'nginx/service.yaml'. The Service is crucial for ensuring that the web server is accessible to clients. A potential issue with the Service could be related to its ability to route traffic correctly to the Pod. Therefore, a steady state should be defined to ensure that the Service is correctly routing traffic to the Pod. A measurable output for this steady state could be the Service's ability to respond to HTTP requests successfully. This can be measured by checking the HTTP response code, which should be 200 (OK) for successful requests.\n- Threshold for the steady state: At least 95% of HTTP requests should return a status code 200.; The steady state we are considering is the ability of the 'example-service' to respond with HTTP status code 200, indicating successful handling of requests. The k6 test results show that 100% of the requests received a status 200 response, which is the desired outcome. To account for potential fluctuations in a real-world scenario, we should set a threshold that allows for a small percentage of requests to fail while still considering the system to be in a steady state. A reasonable threshold would be to expect at least 95% of the requests to return a status 200, allowing for some minor network issues or transient errors.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following K6 Javascript:\n```\nimport http from 'k6/http';\nimport { check } from 'k6';\n\nexport const options = {\n  vus: 5,\n  duration: '5s',\n  thresholds: {\n    // Adding a threshold to ensure that at least 95% of requests return a status code 200\n    'http_req_failed': ['rate<0.05'], // Less than 5% of requests should fail\n  },\n};\n\nexport default function () {\n  const res = http.get('http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:80');\n  check(res, {\n    'is status 200': (r) => r.status === 200,\n  });\n}\n```\n\nA fault scenario that may occur in my system and may affect the steady states:\n\nAn assumed fault scenario is as follows:\n- Event: Cyber Attack\n- Used Chaos Engineering tool: Chaos Mesh\n- Faults to simulate the event: [[{'name': 'PodChaos', 'name_id': 0, 'scope': {'pod': 'example-pod', 'namespace': 'default'}}], [{'name': 'NetworkChaos', 'name_id': 1, 'scope': {'service': 'example-service', 'namespace': 'default'}}]]\n- Description: Given the system's weaknesses, a cyber attack targeting the web server could be highly impactful. The system's main vulnerabilities are the single Pod deployment without redundancy and the Pod's restart policy set to 'Never'. These issues can lead to downtime if the Pod fails, affecting the steady state of the system. To simulate a cyber attack, we can inject faults that exploit these weaknesses. First, we can use PodChaos to simulate a Pod failure, which will test the system's ability to maintain the 'example-pod-running' steady state. Since the Pod won't restart automatically, this will likely cause downtime. Next, we can use NetworkChaos to simulate network latency, which will test the 'example-service-http-response-200' steady state by affecting the Service's ability to route traffic correctly. This sequence simulates a cyber attack by first taking down the Pod and then degrading the network performance, which could happen during a coordinated attack.\n\nPlease follow the instructions below regarding Chaos Engineering as necessary:\n- The Chaos-Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute.\n\nNow, please detail the parameters of the fault \"NetworkChaos({'service': 'example-service', 'namespace': 'default'})\".\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema.
