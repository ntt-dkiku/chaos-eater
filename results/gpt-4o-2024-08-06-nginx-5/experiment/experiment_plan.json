        "thought": "Given the constraints and the nature of the system, we need to design a Chaos Engineering experiment that fits within a 1-minute timeframe. The experiment is divided into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation. The pre-validation phase ensures that the system is in a steady state before we introduce any faults. The fault-injection phase is where we introduce the faults to observe the system's behavior under stress. Finally, the post-validation phase checks if the system returns to its steady state after the faults are removed. \n\nConsidering the time constraint, we need to allocate time efficiently across these phases. The pre-validation phase should be short but sufficient to confirm the system's steady state. Given the steady states defined, we can allocate 10 seconds for pre-validation to check both the pod's running state and the service's HTTP response. The fault-injection phase is the core of the experiment, where we simulate the cyber attack by introducing PodChaos and NetworkChaos. We should allocate the majority of the time here, around 40 seconds, to observe the system's behavior under these conditions. Finally, the post-validation phase should be long enough to ensure the system returns to its steady state, so we allocate 10 seconds for this phase. This allocation ensures that we have a balanced approach to validating the system's resilience within the 1-minute constraint.",

Given the two steady states defined, we will perform unit tests to verify each of them. The first steady state, 'example-pod-running', requires checking that the pod is running at least 80% of the time. The second steady state, 'example-service-http-response-200', requires verifying that at least 95% of HTTP requests return a status code 200. Since the total time for the pre-validation phase is 10 seconds, we will allocate 5 seconds for each unit test. These tests will be executed sequentially to ensure that each steady state is independently verified before moving to the fault injection phase. This approach ensures that we have a clear baseline of the system's behavior under normal conditions, which is crucial for comparing against the system's behavior during and after fault injection.",

        "thought": "In this fault-injection phase, we aim to simulate a cyber attack by injecting two types of faults: PodChaos and NetworkChaos. The total duration for this phase is 40 seconds, so we need to carefully schedule the faults and unit tests to fit within this timeframe. \n\nFirst, we will inject the PodChaos fault to simulate a Pod failure. This will test the system's ability to maintain the 'example-pod-running' steady state. Since the Pod's restart policy is set to 'Never', this fault will likely cause downtime, directly impacting the first steady state. We will start this fault at the beginning of the phase (grace period of 0s) and let it run for 20 seconds. \n\nSimultaneously, we will run the unit test for the 'example-pod-running' steady state to observe the impact of the PodChaos fault. This test will also start at 0s and run for 20 seconds, allowing us to verify if the Pod remains in the 'Running' state at least 80% of the time during the fault.\n\nNext, we will inject the NetworkChaos fault to simulate network latency. This will test the 'example-service-http-response-200' steady state by affecting the Service's ability to route traffic correctly. We will start this fault at 20 seconds (grace period of 20s) and let it run for the remaining 20 seconds of the phase.\n\nSimultaneously, we will run the unit test for the 'example-service-http-response-200' steady state to observe the impact of the NetworkChaos fault. This test will also start at 20 seconds and run for 20 seconds, allowing us to verify if the Service can still respond with HTTP status code 200 for at least 95% of the requests during the fault.\n\nBy staggering the faults and unit tests in this manner, we can effectively observe the system's behavior under each fault condition and ensure that the entire fault-injection phase is completed within the 40-second limit.",

    "summary": "The Chaos Engineering experiment is structured into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation, all within a 1-minute timeframe. \n\nIn the pre-validation phase, which lasts for 10 seconds, two unit tests are conducted sequentially to ensure the system is in a steady state. The first test, 'example-pod-running', is executed immediately at the start of the phase and runs for 5 seconds. This test checks if the pod is running at least 80% of the time. Following this, the second test, 'example-service-http-response-200', begins at the 5-second mark and also runs for 5 seconds, verifying that at least 95% of HTTP requests return a status code 200.\n\nThe fault-injection phase spans 40 seconds and involves two types of fault injections: PodChaos and NetworkChaos. The PodChaos fault is injected at the start of the phase and runs for 20 seconds, simulating a Pod failure. Concurrently, a unit test for 'example-pod-running' is conducted to assess the impact of this fault. At the 20-second mark, the NetworkChaos fault is introduced, running for the remaining 20 seconds to simulate network latency. Simultaneously, a unit test for 'example-service-http-response-200' is performed to evaluate the service's response under network stress.\n\nFinally, the post-validation phase, lasting 10 seconds, verifies the system's return to steady states. The 'example-pod-running' test starts after a 1-second grace period and runs for 5 seconds, checking the pod's status. Subsequently, the 'example-service-http-response-200' test begins after another 1-second grace period and runs for 5 seconds, ensuring the service's HTTP response rate is restored. These tests are executed sequentially to confirm the system's recovery from the injected faults."
