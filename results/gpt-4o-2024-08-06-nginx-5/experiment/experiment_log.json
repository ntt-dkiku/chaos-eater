The Pod is running an NGINX container, which is a popular web server and reverse proxy. The Service is set up to expose this Pod on port 80, which is the default port for HTTP traffic. The use of NGINX and the exposure of port 80 strongly suggest that the application is intended to serve web content or act as a web server. The file names and the use of NGINX further reinforce this assumption.\n\n# Steady states of my system:\n2 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: example-pod-running\n- Description: The first steady state to define should be related to the Pod defined in 'nginx/pod.yaml', as it has the most immediate and critical issues: the Pod's restart policy is set to 'Never', and it is a single Pod deployment without redundancy. These issues can lead to downtime if the Pod fails. Therefore, a steady state should be defined to ensure that the Pod is running and available. A measurable output for this steady state is the number of running Pods, which should be exactly 1, as there is only one Pod defined in the manifest.\n- Threshold for the steady state: The pod should be in the 'Running' state at least 80% of the time during the check period.; The steady state we are considering is the 'example-pod' being in the 'Running' state. The current state shows that the pod was checked 5 times over a duration of 5 seconds, and it was running each time, resulting in a running count of 5. This indicates that the pod is consistently running without any downtime during the check period. To define a reasonable threshold, we need to account for potential minor fluctuations or delays in pod status updates. Therefore, a threshold that allows for a small tolerance would be appropriate. Given the current state, a threshold where the pod is running at least 80% of the time during the check period would be reasonable. This means that out of 5 checks, the pod should be running at least 4 times to satisfy the threshold, which aligns with the current state where it was running all 5 times.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestPodSteadyState(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n\n    def check_pod_status(self, namespace, pod_name):\n        try:\n            pod = self.v1.read_namespaced_pod(name=pod_name, namespace=namespace)\n            return pod.status.phase\n        except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n            print(f\"Exception when calling CoreV1Api->read_namespaced_pod: {e}\")\n            return None\n\n    def test_pod_running_state(self, duration):\n        namespace = 'default'\n        pod_name = 'example-pod'\n        running_count = 0\n\n        # Check the pod status every second for the specified duration\n        for _ in range(duration):\n            status = self.check_pod_status(namespace, pod_name)\n            if status == 'Running':\n                running_count += 1\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the running ratio\n        running_ratio = running_count / duration\n\n        # Assert that the pod is running at least 80% of the time\n        assert running_ratio >= 0.8, f\"Pod '{pod_name}' was not running at least 80% of the time.

The Service is crucial for ensuring that the web server is accessible to clients. A potential issue with the Service could be related to its ability to route traffic correctly to the Pod. Therefore, a steady state should be defined to ensure that the Service is correctly routing traffic to the Pod. A measurable output for this steady state could be the Service's ability to respond to HTTP requests successfully. This can be measured by checking the HTTP response code, which should be 200 (OK) for successful requests.\n- Threshold for the steady state: At least 95% of HTTP requests should return a status code 200.; The steady state we are considering is the ability of the 'example-service' to respond with HTTP status code 200, indicating successful handling of requests. The k6 test results show that 100% of the requests received a status 200 response, which is the desired outcome. To account for potential fluctuations in a real-world scenario, we should set a threshold that allows for a small percentage of requests to fail while still considering the system to be in a steady state. A reasonable threshold would be to expect at least 95% of the requests to return a status 200, allowing for some minor network issues or transient errors.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following K6 Javascript:\n```\nimport http from 'k6/http';\nimport { check } from 'k6';\n\nexport const options = {\n  vus: 5,\n  duration: '5s',\n  thresholds: {\n    // Adding a threshold to ensure that at least 95% of requests return a status code 200\n    'http_req_failed': ['rate<0.05'], // Less than 5% of requests should fail\n  },\n};\n\nexport default function () {\n  const res = http.get('http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:80');\n  check(res, {\n    'is status 200': (r) => r.status === 200,\n  });\n}\n```\n\n# A fault scenario that may occur in my system and may affect the steady states:\n\nAn assumed fault scenario is as follows:\n- Event: Cyber Attack\n- Used Chaos Engineering tool: Chaos Mesh\n- Faults to simulate the event: [[Fault(name='PodChaos', name_id=0, params={'action': 'pod-kill', 'mode': 'one', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}, 'value': '1'})], [Fault(name='NetworkChaos', name_id=1, params={'action': 'delay', 'direction': 'to', 'target': {'mode': 'all', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}}, 'mode': 'all', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}, 'device': 'eth0', 'delay': {'latency': '100ms', 'jitter': '10ms', 'correlation': '50'}})]]\n- Description: Given the system's weaknesses, a cyber attack targeting the web server could be highly impactful. The system's main vulnerabilities are the single Pod deployment without redundancy and the Pod's restart policy set to 'Never'. These issues can lead to downtime if the Pod fails, affecting the steady state of the system. To simulate a cyber attack, we can inject faults that exploit these weaknesses. First, we can use PodChaos to simulate a Pod failure, which will test the system's ability to maintain the 'example-pod-running' steady state. Since the Pod won't restart automatically, this will likely cause downtime. Next, we can use NetworkChaos to simulate network latency, which will test the 'example-service-http-response-200' steady state by affecting the Service's ability to route traffic correctly. This sequence simulates a cyber attack by first taking down the Pod and then degrading the network performance, which could happen during a coordinated attack.\n\n# Please follow the instructions below regarding Chaos Engineering as necessary:\n- The Chaos-Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute.\n\nNow, please plan a Chaos Engineering experiment to check the network system's resiliency that the steady states are remained during fault injection.\nAI: ```json\n{\"thought\":"

Finally, the post-validation phase checks if the system returns to its steady state after the faults are removed. \\n\\nConsidering the time constraint, we need to allocate time efficiently across these phases. The pre-validation phase should be short but sufficient to confirm the system's steady state. Given the steady states defined, we can allocate 10 seconds for pre-validation to check both the pod's running state and the service's HTTP response. The fault-injection phase is the core of the experiment, where we simulate the cyber attack by introducing PodChaos and NetworkChaos. We should allocate the majority of the time here, around 40 seconds, to observe the system's behavior under these conditions. Finally, the post-validation phase should be long enough to ensure the system returns to its steady state, so we allocate 10 seconds for this phase.

These issues can lead to downtime if the Pod fails. Therefore, a steady state should be defined to ensure that the Pod is running and available. A measurable output for this steady state is the number of running Pods, which should be exactly 1, as there is only one Pod defined in the manifest.\n- Threshold for the steady state: The pod should be in the 'Running' state at least 80% of the time during the check period.; The steady state we are considering is the 'example-pod' being in the 'Running' state. The current state shows that the pod was checked 5 times over a duration of 5 seconds, and it was running each time, resulting in a running count of 5. This indicates that the pod is consistently running without any downtime during the check period. To define a reasonable threshold, we need to account for potential minor fluctuations or delays in pod status updates. Therefore, a threshold that allows for a small tolerance would be appropriate. Given the current state, a threshold where the pod is running at least 80% of the time during the check period would be reasonable. This means that out of 5 checks, the pod should be running at least 4 times to satisfy the threshold, which aligns with the current state where it was running all 5 times.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestPodSteadyState(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n\n    def check_pod_status(self, namespace, pod_name):\n        try:\n            pod = self.v1.read_namespaced_pod(name=pod_name, namespace=namespace)\n            return pod.status.phase\n        except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n            print(f\"Exception when calling CoreV1Api->read_namespaced_pod: {e}\")\n            return None\n\n    def test_pod_running_state(self, duration):\n        namespace = 'default'\n        pod_name = 'example-pod'\n        running_count = 0\n\n        # Check the pod status every second for the specified duration\n        for _ in range(duration):\n            status = self.check_pod_status(namespace, pod_name)\n            if status == 'Running':\n                running_count += 1\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the running ratio\n        running_ratio = running_count / duration\n\n        # Assert that the pod is running at least 80% of the time\n        assert running_ratio >= 0.8, f\"Pod '{pod_name}' was not running at least 80% of the time.

The Service is crucial for ensuring that the web server is accessible to clients. A potential issue with the Service could be related to its ability to route traffic correctly to the Pod. Therefore, a steady state should be defined to ensure that the Service is correctly routing traffic to the Pod. A measurable output for this steady state could be the Service's ability to respond to HTTP requests successfully. This can be measured by checking the HTTP response code, which should be 200 (OK) for successful requests.\n- Threshold for the steady state: At least 95% of HTTP requests should return a status code 200.; The steady state we are considering is the ability of the 'example-service' to respond with HTTP status code 200, indicating successful handling of requests. The k6 test results show that 100% of the requests received a status 200 response, which is the desired outcome. To account for potential fluctuations in a real-world scenario, we should set a threshold that allows for a small percentage of requests to fail while still considering the system to be in a steady state.

The system's main vulnerabilities are the single Pod deployment without redundancy and the Pod's restart policy set to 'Never'. These issues can lead to downtime if the Pod fails, affecting the steady state of the system. To simulate a cyber attack, we can inject faults that exploit these weaknesses. First, we can use PodChaos to simulate a Pod failure, which will test the system's ability to maintain the 'example-pod-running' steady state. Since the Pod won't restart automatically, this will likely cause downtime. Next, we can use NetworkChaos to simulate network latency, which will test the 'example-service-http-response-200' steady state by affecting the Service's ability to route traffic correctly.

For example, summarize which fault injections/unit tests will be executed simultaneously, and whether certain fault injections/unit tests will be executed at staggered timings. \n- Be sure to specify both each fault injection/unit test and their corresponding workflow names.\n- When explaining the timeline, provide a detailed description using specific values for duration, grace period, etc. Rephrase the specific values in a way that everyone can easily understand.\n- The meanings of each value are as follows:\n  - Grace Period: Time elapsed from the start of the current phase to the beginning of the fault injection/unit test.\n  - Duration: Duration of the fault injection/unit test. (grace_period + duration) should not exceed the corresponding phase's total time.\n- Never output bullet points.\n- The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"summary\": {\"title\": \"Summary\", \"description\": \"The summary of the given Chaos-Engineering-experiment plan.\", \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"required\": [\"summary\"]}\n```\n\nHuman: # Here is my Chaos-Engineering-experiment plan:\n## Time Schedule\nGiven the constraints and the nature of the system, we need to design a Chaos Engineering experiment that fits within a 1-minute timeframe. The experiment is divided into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation. The pre-validation phase ensures that the system is in a steady state before we introduce any faults. The fault-injection phase is where we introduce the faults to observe the system's behavior under stress. Finally, the post-validation phase checks if the system returns to its steady state after the faults are removed. \n\nConsidering the time constraint, we need to allocate time efficiently across these phases. The pre-validation phase should be short but sufficient to confirm the system's steady state. Given the steady states defined, we can allocate 10 seconds for pre-validation to check both the pod's running state and the service's HTTP response. The fault-injection phase is the core of the experiment, where we simulate the cyber attack by introducing PodChaos and NetworkChaos. We should allocate the majority of the time here, around 40 seconds, to observe the system's behavior under these conditions. Finally, the post-validation phase should be long enough to ensure the system returns to its steady state, so we allocate 10 seconds for this phase. This allocation ensures that we have a balanced approach to validating the system's resilience within the 1-minute constraint.\n\n## Pre-validation Phase\nIn the pre-validation phase, we need to ensure that the system is in its expected steady states before we proceed with fault injection. Given the two steady states defined, we will perform unit tests to verify each of them. The first steady state, 'example-pod-running', requires checking that the pod is running at least 80% of the time. The second steady state, 'example-service-http-response-200', requires verifying that at least 95% of HTTP requests return a status code 200. Since the total time for the pre-validation phase is 10 seconds, we will allocate 5 seconds for each unit test. These tests will be executed sequentially to ensure that each steady state is independently verified before moving to the fault injection phase. This approach ensures that we have a clear baseline of the system's behavior under normal conditions, which is crucial for comparing against the system's behavior during and after fault injection.\n- Verified Steady State #0: ```example-pod-running```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```pre-unittest-example-pod-running```  \n  - Grace Period: ```0s```  \n  - Duration: ```5s```  \n- Verified Steady State #1: ```example-service-http-response-200```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```pre-unittest-example-service-http-response-200```  \n  - Grace Period: ```5s```  \n  - Duration: ```5s```  \n\n\n## Fault-injection Phase \nIn this fault-injection phase, we aim to simulate a cyber attack by injecting two types of faults: PodChaos and NetworkChaos. The total duration for this phase is 40 seconds, so we need to carefully schedule the faults and unit tests to fit within this timeframe. \n\nFirst, we will inject the PodChaos fault to simulate a Pod failure. This will test the system's ability to maintain the 'example-pod-running' steady state. Since the Pod's restart policy is set to 'Never', this fault will likely cause downtime, directly impacting the first steady state. We will start this fault at the beginning of the phase (grace period of 0s) and let it run for 20 seconds. \n\nSimultaneously, we will run the unit test for the 'example-pod-running' steady state to observe the impact of the PodChaos fault. This test will also start at 0s and run for 20 seconds, allowing us to verify if the Pod remains in the 'Running' state at least 80% of the time during the fault.\n\nNext, we will inject the NetworkChaos fault to simulate network latency. This will test the 'example-service-http-response-200' steady state by affecting the Service's ability to route traffic correctly. We will start this fault at 20 seconds (grace period of 20s) and let it run for the remaining 20 seconds of the phase.\n\nSimultaneously, we will run the unit test for the 'example-service-http-response-200' steady state to observe the impact of the NetworkChaos fault. This test will also start at 20 seconds and run for 20 seconds, allowing us to verify if the Service can still respond with HTTP status code 200 for at least 95% of the requests during the fault.\n\nBy staggering the faults and unit tests in this manner, we can effectively observe the system's behavior under each fault condition and ensure that the entire fault-injection phase is completed within the 40-second limit.\n- Verified Steady State #0: ```example-pod-running```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```fault-unittest-example-pod-running```  \n  - Grace Period: ```0s```  \n  - Duration: ```20s```  \n- Verified Steady State #1: ```example-service-http-response-200```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```fault-unittest-example-service-http-response-200```  \n  - Grace Period: ```20s```  \n  - Duration: ```20s```  \n\n\n- Injected Faults #0: ```PodChaos```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```fault-podchaos```  \n  - Grace Period: ```0s```  \n  - Duration: ```20s```  \n- Injected Faults #1: ```NetworkChaos```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```fault-networkchaos```  \n  - Grace Period: ```20s```  \n  - Duration: ```20s```  \n\n\n## Post-validation phase\nIn the post-validation phase, we need to ensure that the system has returned to its steady states after the fault injection. Given the 10-second time constraint, we will perform quick checks to verify each steady state. The first steady state, 'example-pod-running', requires the pod to be in the 'Running' state at least 80% of the time. We will check the pod status every second for 5 seconds, allowing a 1-second grace period for the system to stabilize after the fault injection. The second steady state, 'example-service-http-response-200', requires at least 95% of HTTP requests to return a status code 200. We will perform a quick HTTP request test for 5 seconds, also allowing a 1-second grace period. These tests will be executed sequentially to ensure that each steady state is verified independently, and the system has enough time to recover from the faults.\n- Verified Steady State #0: ```example-pod-running```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```post-unittest-example-pod-running```  \n  - Grace Period: ```1s```  \n  - Duration: ```5s```  \n- Verified Steady State #1: ```example-service-http-response-200```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```post-unittest-example-service-http-response-200```  \n  - Grace Period: ```1s```  \n  - Duration: ```5s```  \n\n\nPlease summarize the above plan.\n\nAI: ```json\n{\"summary\":"
