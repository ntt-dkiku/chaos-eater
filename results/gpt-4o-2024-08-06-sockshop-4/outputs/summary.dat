The Chaos Engineering cycle for the 'sock-shop' application involves a detailed process to test the system's resilience under simulated fault conditions. The application is a microservices-based e-commerce platform deployed on Kubernetes, consisting of various components such as 'carts', 'catalogue', 'orders', 'payment', 'shipping', 'user', and their respective databases. The cycle begins with understanding the user inputs, which include Kubernetes manifests defining the deployment and service configurations for each component. These manifests specify details such as the number of replicas, resource limits, security settings, and service ports.

The cycle identifies several resiliency issues in the system, including missing resource requests in some deployments, a single replica deployment for the 'front-end', high initial delays for liveness probes, and missing port specifications in service manifests. These issues could lead to potential downtime or degraded performance under stress.

The Chaos Engineering experiment is designed to test the hypothesis that the system maintains its steady states even when faults are injected. Two steady states are defined: ensuring at least 2 'carts-db' pods and 1 'front-end' pod are running 95% of the time during a 1-minute monitoring period. Python scripts using the Kubernetes API are provided to verify these steady states.

The fault scenario simulates a Black Friday sale, introducing high load and potential failures. Chaos Mesh is used to inject faults, including StressChaos on 'carts-db' to simulate high CPU and memory usage, PodChaos to kill the 'front-end' pod, and NetworkChaos to introduce network latency on the 'front-end' service.

The experiment is divided into three phases: pre-validation, fault injection, and post-validation, each with specific time allocations to fit within a 1-minute constraint. Pre-validation ensures the system is in a steady state, fault injection introduces the faults, and post-validation checks if the system returns to its steady state.

The experiment is executed using a Chaos Mesh Workflow file, which automates the process according to the plan. The first try of the experiment results in all unit tests passing, indicating that the system maintained its steady states throughout the experiment. This suggests that the system is resilient to the simulated faults, although further improvements could be made to address the identified issues.
