    "description": "During a Black Friday sale, the system is expected to handle a significant increase in traffic and load. This event will test the system's ability to maintain steady states under high demand. The system's weaknesses, such as missing resource requests and single replica deployments, can lead to potential downtime or degraded performance. To simulate this event, we will inject faults that target these weaknesses. First, we will use StressChaos to simulate high CPU and memory usage on the 'carts-db' pods, which lack resource requests, to see if they can maintain the required pod count. Next, we will use PodChaos to kill the single replica 'front-end' pod to test its resilience and recovery. Finally, we will introduce NetworkChaos to simulate network latency on the 'front-end' service, which will test the system's ability to handle network issues during high traffic. This sequence of fault injections will simulate the phenomena of a Black Friday sale, where high load, potential failures, and network issues are common."
