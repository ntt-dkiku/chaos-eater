                "System: You are a helpful AI assistant for Chaos Engineering.\nGiven K8s manifests for a system and user's instructions, you will define the system's steady states (i.e., normal behaviors) that are related to potential issues of the system.\nAlways keep the following rules:\n- Define steady states one by one, starting with the steady state related to the K8s resource that is easiest to encounter issues when certain failures occur.\n- Consider whether a new steady state needs to be added, and if so, add a steady state. If not, indicate the end of the steady-state addition with 'exits=True'.\n- Prioritize adding a steady state related to the issue that is easiest to occur to verify through Chaos Engineering whether it's truly a problem later.\n- An added steady state must be a measurable output, such as the number of pods, throughput, error rates, latency percentiles, etc.\n- An added steady state must be specific to a SINGLE K8s resource (i.e., manifest) having potential issues for resilency and redundancy.\n- An added steady state must be different from the already defined ones.\n- The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"thought\": {\"title\": \"Thought\", \"description\": \"Describe your thought process of determing the steady state of a SINGLE K8s resource (i.e., manifest) that is easiest to encounter the issues. Describe also the details of the steady state itself.\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"exits\": {\"title\": \"Exits\", \"description\": \"Whether to stop adding a new steady state or not. If you stop here, output 'true'. If you keep adding a new steady state, output 'false'.\", \"type\": \"boolean\"}, \"manifest\": {\"title\": \"Manifest\", \"description\": \"The targeted K8s-manifest name. Specify a SINGLE manifest.\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"name\": {\"title\": \"Name\", \"description\": \"Steady state name including the target K8s resource (manifest) name.

details: Pods may not get scheduled if the cluster is under resource pressure, leading to potential downtime.\n  - manifests having the issues: ['sock-shop-2/manifests/03-carts-db-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/07-catalogue-db-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/13-orders-db-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/19-rabbitmq-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/21-session-db-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/27-user-db-dep.yaml']\n  - problematic config: The deployments for carts-db, catalogue-db, orders-db, rabbitmq, session-db, and user-db do not specify resource requests.\n\nIssue #1: Single Replica Deployment\n  - details: The front-end deployment has only one replica, which can lead to downtime if the pod fails.\n  - manifests having the issues: ['sock-shop-2/manifests/09-front-end-dep.yaml']\n  - problematic config: spec.replicas: 1\n\nIssue #2: High Initial Delay for Liveness Probe\n  - details: A high initial delay for the liveness probe can delay the detection of a failed pod, leading to longer downtime.\n  - manifests having the issues: ['sock-shop-2/manifests/05-catalogue-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/09-front-end-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/15-payment-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/25-user-dep.yaml']\n  - problematic config: livenessProbe.initialDelaySeconds: 300\n\nIssue #3: Missing Port Specification in Service\n  - details: The service may not function correctly if the port is not specified, leading to connectivity issues.\n  - manifests having the issues: ['sock-shop-2/manifests/02-carts-svc.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/04-carts-db-svc.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/06-catalogue-svc.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/08-catalogue-db-svc.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/12-orders-svc.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/14-orders-db-svc.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/16-payment-svc.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/18-queue-master-svc.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/22-session-db-svc.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/24-shipping-svc.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/26-user-svc.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/28-user-db-svc.yaml']\n  -

It is a microservices-based application deployed on Kubernetes, with each service handling a specific aspect of the e-commerce process, such as managing the catalogue, processing orders, handling payments, and managing user sessions.; The manifests provided are part of a Kubernetes deployment for a microservices-based application called 'sock-shop'. This is evident from the namespace 'sock-shop' and the naming conventions used in the manifests, such as 'carts', 'catalogue', 'orders', 'payment', 'shipping', 'user', and their respective databases. These components are typical of an e-commerce application, where users can browse a catalogue, add items to a cart, place orders, and make payments. The use of services like RabbitMQ and Redis further supports the assumption of a complex, distributed application architecture, which is common in e-commerce platforms.\n\n# Please follow the instructions below regarding Chaos Engineering:\n- The Chaos-Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute.\n\n- When using k6 in steady-state definition, always select a request URL from the following options (other requests are invalid):\n  1. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/\n  2. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/catalogue?size=10\n  3. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/detail.html?id=<ID>\n  Replace <ID> with an available ID: [`03fef6ac-1896-4ce8-bd69-b798f85c6e0b`, `3395a43e-2d88-40de-b95f-e00e1502085b`, `510a0d7e-8e83-4193-b483-e27e09ddc34d`, `808a2de1-1aaa-4c25-a9b9-6612e8f29a38`, `819e1fbf-8b7e-4f6d-811f-693534916a8b`, `837ab141-399e-4c1f-9abc-bace40296bac`, `a0a4f044-b040-410d-8ead-4de0446aec7e`, `d3588630-ad8e-49df-bbd7-3167f7efb246`, `zzz4f044-b040-410d-8ead-4de0446aec7e`]\n  4. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/category/\n  5. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/category?tags=<TAG>\n  Replace <TAG> with an available tag: [`magic`, `action`, `blue`, `brown`, `black`, `sport`, `formal`, `red`, `green`, `skin`, `geek`]\n  6. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/basket.html\n\n# Steady states already defined are the following:\nNo steady states are defined for now.\n\nAfter considering whether a new steady state needs to be added, define a steady state that are different from the already defined steady states, if necessary.\nAI: ```json\n{\"thought\":"

If you use k6, consider not only appropriate test duration but also an appropriate number of virtual users in the load test.\n- Pay attention to namespace specification. If the namespace is specified in the manifest, it is deployed with the namespace. If not, it is deployed with the 'default' namespace.\n- When sending requests to a K8s resources, use their internal DNS names in the format: ```service-name.namespace.svc.cluster.local:port```. For the port setting, use the service port, not the targetPort or nodePort. Ensure that the port matches the service port defined in the manifest.\n- If other request formats are provided by the user, follow the user's format.\n- The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema.

It is a microservices-based application deployed on Kubernetes, with each service handling a specific aspect of the e-commerce process, such as managing the catalogue, processing orders, handling payments, and managing user sessions.; The manifests provided are part of a Kubernetes deployment for a microservices-based application called 'sock-shop'. This is evident from the namespace 'sock-shop' and the naming conventions used in the manifests, such as 'carts', 'catalogue', 'orders', 'payment', 'shipping', 'user', and their respective databases. These components are typical of an e-commerce application, where users can browse a catalogue, add items to a cart, place orders, and make payments. The use of services like RabbitMQ and Redis further supports the assumption of a complex, distributed application architecture, which is common in e-commerce platforms.\n\n# You will determine a reasonable threshold for the following steady state of my system:\ncarts-db-pod-count: The first issue to address is the 'Missing Resource Requests' in the 'carts-db' Deployment.

It is a microservices-based application deployed on Kubernetes, with each service handling a specific aspect of the e-commerce process, such as managing the catalogue, processing orders, handling payments, and managing user sessions.; The manifests provided are part of a Kubernetes deployment for a microservices-based application called 'sock-shop'. This is evident from the namespace 'sock-shop' and the naming conventions used in the manifests, such as 'carts', 'catalogue', 'orders', 'payment', 'shipping', 'user', and their respective databases. These components are typical of an e-commerce application, where users can browse a catalogue, add items to a cart, place orders, and make payments. The use of services like RabbitMQ and Redis further supports the assumption of a complex, distributed application architecture, which is common in e-commerce platforms.\n\n# Please follow the instructions below regarding Chaos Engineering:\n- The Chaos-Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute.\n\n- When using k6 in steady-state definition, always select a request URL from the following options (other requests are invalid):\n  1. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/\n  2. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/catalogue?size=10\n  3. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/detail.html?id=<ID>\n  Replace <ID> with an available ID: [`03fef6ac-1896-4ce8-bd69-b798f85c6e0b`, `3395a43e-2d88-40de-b95f-e00e1502085b`, `510a0d7e-8e83-4193-b483-e27e09ddc34d`, `808a2de1-1aaa-4c25-a9b9-6612e8f29a38`, `819e1fbf-8b7e-4f6d-811f-693534916a8b`, `837ab141-399e-4c1f-9abc-bace40296bac`, `a0a4f044-b040-410d-8ead-4de0446aec7e`, `d3588630-ad8e-49df-bbd7-3167f7efb246`, `zzz4f044-b040-410d-8ead-4de0446aec7e`]\n  4. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/category/\n  5. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/category?tags=<TAG>\n  Replace <TAG> with an available tag: [`magic`, `action`, `blue`, `brown`, `black`, `sport`, `formal`, `red`, `green`, `skin`, `geek`]\n  6. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/basket.html\n\n# Steady states already defined are the following:\n1 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: carts-db-pod-count\n- Description: The first issue to address is the 'Missing Resource Requests' in the 'carts-db' Deployment. This is a critical issue because without resource requests, the pods may not get scheduled if the cluster is under resource pressure, leading to potential downtime. To verify the steady state, we can measure the number of 'carts-db' pods running, ensuring it matches the expected replica count of 2. This will help us understand if the pods are being scheduled correctly despite the missing resource requests.\n- Threshold for the steady state: At least 2 'carts-db' pods must be running 95% of the time within a 1-minute monitoring period.; The steady state we are examining is the number of 'carts-db' pods running, which should match the expected replica count of 2. The current state shows that the pod count consistently matches the expected count of 2 over multiple checks. Given that the system is expected to maintain 2 replicas, the threshold should ensure that at least 2 pods are running to maintain redundancy and availability. To account for potential fluctuations, such as during pod restarts or updates, a reasonable tolerance can be applied. For example, allowing a brief period where the pod count might drop to 1, but it should recover quickly. Therefore, the threshold can be defined as maintaining at least 2 'carts-db' pods running 95% of the time within a 1-minute monitoring period. This allows for brief fluctuations while ensuring the system remains stable and available.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestCartsDBPodCount(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.v1_apps = client.AppsV1Api()\n\n    def check_carts_db_pod_count(self, namespace, expected_count):\n        pod_count = 0\n        try:\n            resp = self.v1_apps.read_namespaced_deployment(name='carts-db', namespace=namespace)\n            pod_count = resp.status.replicas\n        except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n            print(f\"Exception when calling AppsV1Api->read_namespaced_deployment: {e}\")\n        return pod_count\n\n    def test_steady_state(self, duration):\n        namespace = 'sock-shop'\n        expected_count = 2\n        successful_checks = 0\n\n        for _ in range(duration):\n            pod_count = self.check_carts_db_pod_count(namespace, expected_count)\n            print(f\"Current 'carts-db' pod count: {pod_count}\")\n            if pod_count == expected_count:\n                successful_checks += 1\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the percentage of successful checks\n        success_percentage = (successful_checks / duration) * 100\n        print(f\"Success percentage: {success_percentage}%\")\n\n        # Assert that the success percentage is at least 95%\n        assert success_percentage >= 95, f\"Pod count was not stable enough: {success_percentage}% < 95%\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test carts-db pod count steady state.')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=60, help='Duration to check the pod count in seconds')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    test = TestCartsDBPodCount()\n    test.test_steady_state(args.duration)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\n```\n\nAfter considering whether a new steady state needs to be added, define a steady state that are different from the already defined steady states, if necessary.\nAI: ```json\n{\"thought\":"

If you use k6, consider not only appropriate test duration but also an appropriate number of virtual users in the load test.\n- Pay attention to namespace specification. If the namespace is specified in the manifest, it is deployed with the namespace. If not, it is deployed with the 'default' namespace.\n- When sending requests to a K8s resources, use their internal DNS names in the format: ```service-name.namespace.svc.cluster.local:port```. For the port setting, use the service port, not the targetPort or nodePort. Ensure that the port matches the service port defined in the manifest.\n- If other request formats are provided by the user, follow the user's format.\n- The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema.

It is a microservices-based application deployed on Kubernetes, with each service handling a specific aspect of the e-commerce process, such as managing the catalogue, processing orders, handling payments, and managing user sessions.; The manifests provided are part of a Kubernetes deployment for a microservices-based application called 'sock-shop'. This is evident from the namespace 'sock-shop' and the naming conventions used in the manifests, such as 'carts', 'catalogue', 'orders', 'payment', 'shipping', 'user', and their respective databases. These components are typical of an e-commerce application, where users can browse a catalogue, add items to a cart, place orders, and make payments. The use of services like RabbitMQ and Redis further supports the assumption of a complex, distributed application architecture, which is common in e-commerce platforms.\n\n# You will determine a reasonable threshold for the following steady state of my system:\nfront-end-pod-count: The next issue to address is the 'Single Replica Deployment' in the 'front-end' Deployment. This is a critical issue because having only one replica can lead to downtime if the pod fails. To verify the steady state, we can measure the number of 'front-end' pods running, ensuring it matches the expected replica count of 1. This will help us understand if the pod is being scheduled correctly and remains available despite being a single replica.
