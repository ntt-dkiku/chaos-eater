The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"thought\": {\"title\": \"Thought\", \"describe\": \"Think about the total time and the reasonable time allocation for each phase that you are about to design, and explain your thought process in detail.\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"total_time\": {\"title\": \"Total Time\", \"description\": \"Total time of the entire chaos experiment. total_time should equal to the sum of pre_validation_time, fault_injection_time, and post_validation_time.\", \"example\": \"10m\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"pre_validation_time\": {\"title\": \"Pre Validation Time\", \"description\": \"Total time of validation before fault injection.\", \"example\": \"2m\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"fault_injection_time\": {\"title\": \"Fault Injection Time\", \"description\": \"Total time of fault injection.\", \"example\": \"6m\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"post_validation_time\": {\"title\": \"Post Validation Time\", \"description\": \"Total time of validation after fault injection.\", \"example\": \"2m\", \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"required\": [\"thought\", \"total_time\", \"pre_validation_time\", \"fault_injection_time\", \"post_validation_time\"]}\n```\nHuman: # Here is the overview of my system:\nThe system consists of the following K8s manifest(s):K8s manifest: sock-shop-2/manifests/00-sock-shop-ns.yaml\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Namespace\nmetadata:\n  name: sock-shop\n\n```\nSummary of sock-shop-2/manifests/00-sock-shop-ns.yaml:\n- This manifest defines a Kubernetes Namespace.\n- The Namespace is named 'sock-shop'.\n- Namespaces are used to organize and manage resources within a Kubernetes cluster, providing a way to divide cluster resources between multiple users or teams.\n\nK8s manifest: sock-shop-2/manifests/01-carts-dep.yaml\n```yaml\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: carts\n  labels:\n    name: carts\n  namespace: sock-shop\nspec:\n  replicas: 2\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      name: carts\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        name: carts\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      -

It is a microservices-based application deployed on Kubernetes, with each service handling a specific aspect of the e-commerce process, such as managing the catalogue, processing orders, handling payments, and managing user sessions.; The manifests provided are part of a Kubernetes deployment for a microservices-based application called 'sock-shop'. This is evident from the namespace 'sock-shop' and the naming conventions used in the manifests, such as 'carts', 'catalogue', 'orders', 'payment', 'shipping', 'user', and their respective databases. These components are typical of an e-commerce application, where users can browse a catalogue, add items to a cart, place orders, and make payments. The use of services like RabbitMQ and Redis further supports the assumption of a complex, distributed application architecture, which is common in e-commerce platforms.\n\n# Steady states of my system:\n2 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: carts-db-pod-count\n- Description: The first issue to address is the 'Missing Resource Requests' in the 'carts-db' Deployment. This is a critical issue because without resource requests, the pods may not get scheduled if the cluster is under resource pressure, leading to potential downtime. To verify the steady state, we can measure the number of 'carts-db' pods running, ensuring it matches the expected replica count of 2. This will help us understand if the pods are being scheduled correctly despite the missing resource requests.\n- Threshold for the steady state: At least 2 'carts-db' pods must be running 95% of the time within a 1-minute monitoring period.; The steady state we are examining is the number of 'carts-db' pods running, which should match the expected replica count of 2. The current state shows that the pod count consistently matches the expected count of 2 over multiple checks. Given that the system is expected to maintain 2 replicas, the threshold should ensure that at least 2 pods are running to maintain redundancy and availability. To account for potential fluctuations, such as during pod restarts or updates, a reasonable tolerance can be applied. For example, allowing a brief period where the pod count might drop to 1, but it should recover quickly. Therefore, the threshold can be defined as maintaining at least 2 'carts-db' pods running 95% of the time within a 1-minute monitoring period. This allows for brief fluctuations while ensuring the system remains stable and available.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestCartsDBPodCount(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.v1_apps = client.AppsV1Api()\n\n    def check_carts_db_pod_count(self, namespace, expected_count):\n        pod_count = 0\n        try:\n            resp = self.v1_apps.read_namespaced_deployment(name='carts-db', namespace=namespace)\n            pod_count = resp.status.replicas\n        except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n            print(f\"Exception when calling AppsV1Api->read_namespaced_deployment: {e}\")\n        return pod_count\n\n    def test_steady_state(self, duration):\n        namespace = 'sock-shop'\n        expected_count = 2\n        successful_checks = 0\n\n        for _ in range(duration):\n            pod_count = self.check_carts_db_pod_count(namespace, expected_count)\n            print(f\"Current 'carts-db' pod count: {pod_count}\")\n            if pod_count == expected_count:\n                successful_checks += 1\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the percentage of successful checks\n        success_percentage = (successful_checks / duration) * 100\n        print(f\"Success percentage: {success_percentage}%\")\n\n        # Assert that the success percentage is at least 95%\n        assert success_percentage >= 95, f\"Pod count was not stable enough: {success_percentage}% < 95%\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test carts-db pod count steady state.')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=60, help='Duration to check the pod count in seconds')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    test = TestCartsDBPodCount()\n    test.test_steady_state(args.duration)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\n```2nd steady states:\n- Name: front-end-pod-count\n- Description: The next issue to address is the 'Single Replica Deployment' in the 'front-end' Deployment. This is a critical issue because having only one replica can lead to downtime if the pod fails. To verify the steady state, we can measure the number of 'front-end' pods running, ensuring it matches the expected replica count of 1. This will help us understand if the pod is being scheduled correctly and remains available despite being a single replica. Monitoring the pod count will allow us to verify the system's resilience to potential failures.\n- Threshold for the steady state: At least 1 front-end pod must be running 95% of the time during a 1-minute monitoring period.; The current state of the system shows that the front-end pod count is consistently at 1, which matches the expected replica count as per the deployment configuration. Given that the system is currently stable with a single replica, the threshold should ensure that at least 1 front-end pod is running at all times. However, to account for potential fluctuations or brief disruptions, a reasonable tolerance should be included. Since the experiment must be completed within 1 minute, we can set a threshold that allows for a brief period where the pod count might temporarily drop below 1, but it should recover quickly. Therefore, the threshold can be defined as having at least 1 front-end pod running 95% of the time during the 1-minute monitoring period. This allows for a brief 3-second window where the pod count might be 0, but it should not persist beyond that.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestFrontEndPodCount(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self, namespace, duration):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.namespace = namespace\n        self.duration = duration\n\n    def test_front_end_pod_count(self):\n        pod_label_selector = 'name=front-end'\n        successful_checks = 0\n\n        # Check the pod count every second for the specified duration\n        for _ in range(self.duration):\n            pods = self.v1.list_namespaced_pod(namespace=self.namespace, label_selector=pod_label_selector)\n            pod_count = len(pods.items)\n            print(f'Current front-end pod count: {pod_count}')\n\n            # Increment successful checks if pod count is 1 or more\n            if pod_count >= 1:\n                successful_checks += 1\n\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the percentage of successful checks\n        success_rate = (successful_checks / self.duration) * 100\n        print(f'Success rate: {success_rate}%')\n\n        # Assert that the success rate meets the 95% threshold\n        assert success_rate >= 95, f\"Front-end pod count did not meet the 95% threshold.

This event will test the system's ability to maintain steady states under high demand. The system's weaknesses, such as missing resource requests and single replica deployments, can lead to potential downtime or degraded performance. To simulate this event, we will inject faults that target these weaknesses. First, we will use StressChaos to simulate high CPU and memory usage on the 'carts-db' pods, which lack resource requests, to see if they can maintain the required pod count. Next, we will use PodChaos to kill the single replica 'front-end' pod to test its resilience and recovery. Finally, we will introduce NetworkChaos to simulate network latency on the 'front-end' service, which will test the system's ability to handle network issues during high traffic. This sequence of fault injections will simulate the phenomena of a Black Friday sale, where high load, potential failures, and network issues are common.\n\n# Please follow the instructions below regarding Chaos Engineering as necessary:\n- The Chaos-Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute.\n\n- When using k6 in steady-state definition, always select a request URL from the following options (other requests are invalid):\n  1. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/\n  2. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/catalogue?size=10\n  3. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/detail.html?id=<ID>\n  Replace <ID> with an available ID: [`03fef6ac-1896-4ce8-bd69-b798f85c6e0b`, `3395a43e-2d88-40de-b95f-e00e1502085b`, `510a0d7e-8e83-4193-b483-e27e09ddc34d`, `808a2de1-1aaa-4c25-a9b9-6612e8f29a38`, `819e1fbf-8b7e-4f6d-811f-693534916a8b`, `837ab141-399e-4c1f-9abc-bace40296bac`, `a0a4f044-b040-410d-8ead-4de0446aec7e`, `d3588630-ad8e-49df-bbd7-3167f7efb246`, `zzz4f044-b040-410d-8ead-4de0446aec7e`]\n  4. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/category/\n  5. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/category?tags=<TAG>\n  Replace <TAG> with an available tag: [`magic`, `action`, `blue`, `brown`, `black`, `sport`, `formal`, `red`, `green`, `skin`, `geek`]\n  6. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/basket.html\n\nNow, please plan a Chaos Engineering experiment to check the network system's resiliency that the steady states are remained during fault injection.\nAI: ```json\n{\"thought\":"

            "{\"thought\":\"To design a Chaos Engineering experiment that fits within the 1-minute constraint, we need to allocate time efficiently across the three phases: pre-validation, fault injection, and post-validation. Given the steady states and the fault scenario, we should ensure that each phase is long enough to gather meaningful data while staying within the total time limit. \\n\\n1. **Pre-validation Phase**: This phase is crucial to ensure that the system is in a steady state before we introduce any faults. We need to verify that the 'carts-db' and 'front-end' pods are running as expected. Given the 1-minute total time constraint, we can allocate 15 seconds for this phase. This should be sufficient to run the steady state checks for both 'carts-db' and 'front-end' pods, as the checks are designed to run quickly.\\n\\n2. **Fault Injection Phase**: This is the core of the experiment where we introduce the faults. We have three faults to inject: StressChaos on 'carts-db', PodChaos on 'front-end', and NetworkChaos on 'front-end'. We need to observe the system's behavior under these conditions. Allocating 30 seconds for this phase allows us to introduce each fault and observe the immediate impact on the system. This duration is a compromise between observing the effects and staying within the time limit.\\n\\n3. **Post-validation Phase**: After the faults are removed, we need to ensure that the system returns to its steady state. This phase should verify that the 'carts-db' and 'front-end' pods are back to their expected counts. Allocating 15 seconds for this phase allows us to run the steady state checks again to confirm recovery.\\n\\nIn summary, the time allocation is 15 seconds for pre-validation, 30 seconds for fault injection, and 15 seconds for post-validation, totaling 60 seconds.\",\"total_time\":\"60s\",\"pre_validation_time\":\"15s\",\"fault_injection_time\":\"30s\",\"post_validation_time\":\"15s\"}\n",

It is a microservices-based application deployed on Kubernetes, with each service handling a specific aspect of the e-commerce process, such as managing the catalogue, processing orders, handling payments, and managing user sessions.; The manifests provided are part of a Kubernetes deployment for a microservices-based application called 'sock-shop'. This is evident from the namespace 'sock-shop' and the naming conventions used in the manifests, such as 'carts', 'catalogue', 'orders', 'payment', 'shipping', 'user', and their respective databases. These components are typical of an e-commerce application, where users can browse a catalogue, add items to a cart, place orders, and make payments. The use of services like RabbitMQ and Redis further supports the assumption of a complex, distributed application architecture, which is common in e-commerce platforms.\n\n# Steady states of my system:\n2 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: carts-db-pod-count\n- Description: The first issue to address is the 'Missing Resource Requests' in the 'carts-db' Deployment. This is a critical issue because without resource requests, the pods may not get scheduled if the cluster is under resource pressure, leading to potential downtime. To verify the steady state, we can measure the number of 'carts-db' pods running, ensuring it matches the expected replica count of 2. This will help us understand if the pods are being scheduled correctly despite the missing resource requests.\n- Threshold for the steady state: At least 2 'carts-db' pods must be running 95% of the time within a 1-minute monitoring period.; The steady state we are examining is the number of 'carts-db' pods running, which should match the expected replica count of 2. The current state shows that the pod count consistently matches the expected count of 2 over multiple checks. Given that the system is expected to maintain 2 replicas, the threshold should ensure that at least 2 pods are running to maintain redundancy and availability. To account for potential fluctuations, such as during pod restarts or updates, a reasonable tolerance can be applied. For example, allowing a brief period where the pod count might drop to 1, but it should recover quickly. Therefore, the threshold can be defined as maintaining at least 2 'carts-db' pods running 95% of the time within a 1-minute monitoring period. This allows for brief fluctuations while ensuring the system remains stable and available.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestCartsDBPodCount(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.v1_apps = client.AppsV1Api()\n\n    def check_carts_db_pod_count(self, namespace, expected_count):\n        pod_count = 0\n        try:\n            resp = self.v1_apps.read_namespaced_deployment(name='carts-db', namespace=namespace)\n            pod_count = resp.status.replicas\n        except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n            print(f\"Exception when calling AppsV1Api->read_namespaced_deployment: {e}\")\n        return pod_count\n\n    def test_steady_state(self, duration):\n        namespace = 'sock-shop'\n        expected_count = 2\n        successful_checks = 0\n\n        for _ in range(duration):\n            pod_count = self.check_carts_db_pod_count(namespace, expected_count)\n            print(f\"Current 'carts-db' pod count: {pod_count}\")\n            if pod_count == expected_count:\n                successful_checks += 1\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the percentage of successful checks\n        success_percentage = (successful_checks / duration) * 100\n        print(f\"Success percentage: {success_percentage}%\")\n\n        # Assert that the success percentage is at least 95%\n        assert success_percentage >= 95, f\"Pod count was not stable enough: {success_percentage}% < 95%\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test carts-db pod count steady state.')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=60, help='Duration to check the pod count in seconds')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    test = TestCartsDBPodCount()\n    test.test_steady_state(args.duration)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\n```2nd steady states:\n- Name: front-end-pod-count\n- Description: The next issue to address is the 'Single Replica Deployment' in the 'front-end' Deployment. This is a critical issue because having only one replica can lead to downtime if the pod fails. To verify the steady state, we can measure the number of 'front-end' pods running, ensuring it matches the expected replica count of 1. This will help us understand if the pod is being scheduled correctly and remains available despite being a single replica. Monitoring the pod count will allow us to verify the system's resilience to potential failures.\n- Threshold for the steady state: At least 1 front-end pod must be running 95% of the time during a 1-minute monitoring period.; The current state of the system shows that the front-end pod count is consistently at 1, which matches the expected replica count as per the deployment configuration. Given that the system is currently stable with a single replica, the threshold should ensure that at least 1 front-end pod is running at all times. However, to account for potential fluctuations or brief disruptions, a reasonable tolerance should be included. Since the experiment must be completed within 1 minute, we can set a threshold that allows for a brief period where the pod count might temporarily drop below 1, but it should recover quickly. Therefore, the threshold can be defined as having at least 1 front-end pod running 95% of the time during the 1-minute monitoring period. This allows for a brief 3-second window where the pod count might be 0, but it should not persist beyond that.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestFrontEndPodCount(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self, namespace, duration):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.namespace = namespace\n        self.duration = duration\n\n    def test_front_end_pod_count(self):\n        pod_label_selector = 'name=front-end'\n        successful_checks = 0\n\n        # Check the pod count every second for the specified duration\n        for _ in range(self.duration):\n            pods = self.v1.list_namespaced_pod(namespace=self.namespace, label_selector=pod_label_selector)\n            pod_count = len(pods.items)\n            print(f'Current front-end pod count: {pod_count}')\n\n            # Increment successful checks if pod count is 1 or more\n            if pod_count >= 1:\n                successful_checks += 1\n\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the percentage of successful checks\n        success_rate = (successful_checks / self.duration) * 100\n        print(f'Success rate: {success_rate}%')\n\n        # Assert that the success rate meets the 95% threshold\n        assert success_rate >= 95, f\"Front-end pod count did not meet the 95% threshold.

This event will test the system's ability to maintain steady states under high demand. The system's weaknesses, such as missing resource requests and single replica deployments, can lead to potential downtime or degraded performance. To simulate this event, we will inject faults that target these weaknesses. First, we will use StressChaos to simulate high CPU and memory usage on the 'carts-db' pods, which lack resource requests, to see if they can maintain the required pod count. Next, we will use PodChaos to kill the single replica 'front-end' pod to test its resilience and recovery. Finally, we will introduce NetworkChaos to simulate network latency on the 'front-end' service, which will test the system's ability to handle network issues during high traffic. This sequence of fault injections will simulate the phenomena of a Black Friday sale, where high load, potential failures, and network issues are common.\n\n# Please follow the instructions below regarding Chaos Engineering as necessary:\n- The Chaos-Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute.\n\n- When using k6 in steady-state definition, always select a request URL from the following options (other requests are invalid):\n  1. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/\n  2. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/catalogue?size=10\n  3. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/detail.html?id=<ID>\n  Replace <ID> with an available ID: [`03fef6ac-1896-4ce8-bd69-b798f85c6e0b`, `3395a43e-2d88-40de-b95f-e00e1502085b`, `510a0d7e-8e83-4193-b483-e27e09ddc34d`, `808a2de1-1aaa-4c25-a9b9-6612e8f29a38`, `819e1fbf-8b7e-4f6d-811f-693534916a8b`, `837ab141-399e-4c1f-9abc-bace40296bac`, `a0a4f044-b040-410d-8ead-4de0446aec7e`, `d3588630-ad8e-49df-bbd7-3167f7efb246`, `zzz4f044-b040-410d-8ead-4de0446aec7e`]\n  4. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/category/\n  5. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/category?tags=<TAG>\n  Replace <TAG> with an available tag: [`magic`, `action`, `blue`, `brown`, `black`, `sport`, `formal`, `red`, `green`, `skin`, `geek`]\n  6. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/basket.html\n\nNow, please detail the pre-validation phase.

It is a microservices-based application deployed on Kubernetes, with each service handling a specific aspect of the e-commerce process, such as managing the catalogue, processing orders, handling payments, and managing user sessions.; The manifests provided are part of a Kubernetes deployment for a microservices-based application called 'sock-shop'. This is evident from the namespace 'sock-shop' and the naming conventions used in the manifests, such as 'carts', 'catalogue', 'orders', 'payment', 'shipping', 'user', and their respective databases. These components are typical of an e-commerce application, where users can browse a catalogue, add items to a cart, place orders, and make payments. The use of services like RabbitMQ and Redis further supports the assumption of a complex, distributed application architecture, which is common in e-commerce platforms.\n\n# Steady states of my system:\n2 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: carts-db-pod-count\n- Description: The first issue to address is the 'Missing Resource Requests' in the 'carts-db' Deployment. This is a critical issue because without resource requests, the pods may not get scheduled if the cluster is under resource pressure, leading to potential downtime. To verify the steady state, we can measure the number of 'carts-db' pods running, ensuring it matches the expected replica count of 2. This will help us understand if the pods are being scheduled correctly despite the missing resource requests.\n- Threshold for the steady state: At least 2 'carts-db' pods must be running 95% of the time within a 1-minute monitoring period.; The steady state we are examining is the number of 'carts-db' pods running, which should match the expected replica count of 2. The current state shows that the pod count consistently matches the expected count of 2 over multiple checks. Given that the system is expected to maintain 2 replicas, the threshold should ensure that at least 2 pods are running to maintain redundancy and availability. To account for potential fluctuations, such as during pod restarts or updates, a reasonable tolerance can be applied. For example, allowing a brief period where the pod count might drop to 1, but it should recover quickly. Therefore, the threshold can be defined as maintaining at least 2 'carts-db' pods running 95% of the time within a 1-minute monitoring period. This allows for brief fluctuations while ensuring the system remains stable and available.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestCartsDBPodCount(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.v1_apps = client.AppsV1Api()\n\n    def check_carts_db_pod_count(self, namespace, expected_count):\n        pod_count = 0\n        try:\n            resp = self.v1_apps.read_namespaced_deployment(name='carts-db', namespace=namespace)\n            pod_count = resp.status.replicas\n        except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n            print(f\"Exception when calling AppsV1Api->read_namespaced_deployment: {e}\")\n        return pod_count\n\n    def test_steady_state(self, duration):\n        namespace = 'sock-shop'\n        expected_count = 2\n        successful_checks = 0\n\n        for _ in range(duration):\n            pod_count = self.check_carts_db_pod_count(namespace, expected_count)\n            print(f\"Current 'carts-db' pod count: {pod_count}\")\n            if pod_count == expected_count:\n                successful_checks += 1\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the percentage of successful checks\n        success_percentage = (successful_checks / duration) * 100\n        print(f\"Success percentage: {success_percentage}%\")\n\n        # Assert that the success percentage is at least 95%\n        assert success_percentage >= 95, f\"Pod count was not stable enough: {success_percentage}% < 95%\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test carts-db pod count steady state.')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=60, help='Duration to check the pod count in seconds')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    test = TestCartsDBPodCount()\n    test.test_steady_state(args.duration)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\n```2nd steady states:\n- Name: front-end-pod-count\n- Description: The next issue to address is the 'Single Replica Deployment' in the 'front-end' Deployment. This is a critical issue because having only one replica can lead to downtime if the pod fails. To verify the steady state, we can measure the number of 'front-end' pods running, ensuring it matches the expected replica count of 1. This will help us understand if the pod is being scheduled correctly and remains available despite being a single replica. Monitoring the pod count will allow us to verify the system's resilience to potential failures.\n- Threshold for the steady state: At least 1 front-end pod must be running 95% of the time during a 1-minute monitoring period.; The current state of the system shows that the front-end pod count is consistently at 1, which matches the expected replica count as per the deployment configuration. Given that the system is currently stable with a single replica, the threshold should ensure that at least 1 front-end pod is running at all times. However, to account for potential fluctuations or brief disruptions, a reasonable tolerance should be included. Since the experiment must be completed within 1 minute, we can set a threshold that allows for a brief period where the pod count might temporarily drop below 1, but it should recover quickly. Therefore, the threshold can be defined as having at least 1 front-end pod running 95% of the time during the 1-minute monitoring period. This allows for a brief 3-second window where the pod count might be 0, but it should not persist beyond that.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestFrontEndPodCount(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self, namespace, duration):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.namespace = namespace\n        self.duration = duration\n\n    def test_front_end_pod_count(self):\n        pod_label_selector = 'name=front-end'\n        successful_checks = 0\n\n        # Check the pod count every second for the specified duration\n        for _ in range(self.duration):\n            pods = self.v1.list_namespaced_pod(namespace=self.namespace, label_selector=pod_label_selector)\n            pod_count = len(pods.items)\n            print(f'Current front-end pod count: {pod_count}')\n\n            # Increment successful checks if pod count is 1 or more\n            if pod_count >= 1:\n                successful_checks += 1\n\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the percentage of successful checks\n        success_rate = (successful_checks / self.duration) * 100\n        print(f'Success rate: {success_rate}%')\n\n        # Assert that the success rate meets the 95% threshold\n        assert success_rate >= 95, f\"Front-end pod count did not meet the 95% threshold.

This event will test the system's ability to maintain steady states under high demand. The system's weaknesses, such as missing resource requests and single replica deployments, can lead to potential downtime or degraded performance. To simulate this event, we will inject faults that target these weaknesses. First, we will use StressChaos to simulate high CPU and memory usage on the 'carts-db' pods, which lack resource requests, to see if they can maintain the required pod count. Next, we will use PodChaos to kill the single replica 'front-end' pod to test its resilience and recovery. Finally, we will introduce NetworkChaos to simulate network latency on the 'front-end' service, which will test the system's ability to handle network issues during high traffic. This sequence of fault injections will simulate the phenomena of a Black Friday sale, where high load, potential failures, and network issues are common.\n\n# Please follow the instructions below regarding Chaos Engineering as necessary:\n- The Chaos-Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute.\n\n- When using k6 in steady-state definition, always select a request URL from the following options (other requests are invalid):\n  1. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/\n  2. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/catalogue?size=10\n  3. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/detail.html?id=<ID>\n  Replace <ID> with an available ID: [`03fef6ac-1896-4ce8-bd69-b798f85c6e0b`, `3395a43e-2d88-40de-b95f-e00e1502085b`, `510a0d7e-8e83-4193-b483-e27e09ddc34d`, `808a2de1-1aaa-4c25-a9b9-6612e8f29a38`, `819e1fbf-8b7e-4f6d-811f-693534916a8b`, `837ab141-399e-4c1f-9abc-bace40296bac`, `a0a4f044-b040-410d-8ead-4de0446aec7e`, `d3588630-ad8e-49df-bbd7-3167f7efb246`, `zzz4f044-b040-410d-8ead-4de0446aec7e`]\n  4. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/category/\n  5. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/category?tags=<TAG>\n  Replace <TAG> with an available tag: [`magic`, `action`, `blue`, `brown`, `black`, `sport`, `formal`, `red`, `green`, `skin`, `geek`]\n  6. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/basket.html\n\nNow, please detail the fault-injection phase.

            "{\"thought\": \"In this fault-injection phase, we aim to simulate a Black Friday sale scenario by introducing stress and disruptions to the system. The phase is designed to last 30 seconds, and we will inject three types of faults sequentially to observe the system's behavior under stress. The sequence and timing of the fault injections are crucial to effectively simulate the scenario and observe the system's resilience.\\n\\n1. **StressChaos on 'carts-db' Pods**: We will start by injecting a StressChaos fault targeting the 'carts-db' pods. This fault will simulate high CPU and memory usage, which is typical during a high-traffic event like Black Friday. The stress will be applied for 10 seconds, starting immediately at the beginning of the phase (grace period of 0s). This will help us observe if the 'carts-db' pods can maintain the required pod count despite the missing resource requests.\\n\\n2. **PodChaos on 'front-end' Pod**: After the StressChaos, we will introduce a PodChaos fault to kill the single replica 'front-end' pod. This fault will be injected at the 10-second mark (grace period of 10s) and will last for 10 seconds. This will test the system's ability to recover from a pod failure, especially since the 'front-end' deployment has only one replica.\\n\\n3. **NetworkChaos on 'front-end' Service**: Finally, we will inject a NetworkChaos fault to introduce network latency on the 'front-end' service. This fault will be injected at the 20-second mark (grace period of 20s) and will last for 10 seconds. This simulates network issues that might occur during high traffic, testing the system's ability to handle such disruptions.\\n\\nThe faults are injected sequentially to ensure that each fault's impact can be observed independently, while also simulating a realistic scenario where multiple issues might occur in quick succession during a high-demand event.

It is a microservices-based application deployed on Kubernetes, with each service handling a specific aspect of the e-commerce process, such as managing the catalogue, processing orders, handling payments, and managing user sessions.; The manifests provided are part of a Kubernetes deployment for a microservices-based application called 'sock-shop'. This is evident from the namespace 'sock-shop' and the naming conventions used in the manifests, such as 'carts', 'catalogue', 'orders', 'payment', 'shipping', 'user', and their respective databases. These components are typical of an e-commerce application, where users can browse a catalogue, add items to a cart, place orders, and make payments. The use of services like RabbitMQ and Redis further supports the assumption of a complex, distributed application architecture, which is common in e-commerce platforms.\n\n# Steady states of my system:\n2 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: carts-db-pod-count\n- Description: The first issue to address is the 'Missing Resource Requests' in the 'carts-db' Deployment. This is a critical issue because without resource requests, the pods may not get scheduled if the cluster is under resource pressure, leading to potential downtime. To verify the steady state, we can measure the number of 'carts-db' pods running, ensuring it matches the expected replica count of 2. This will help us understand if the pods are being scheduled correctly despite the missing resource requests.\n- Threshold for the steady state: At least 2 'carts-db' pods must be running 95% of the time within a 1-minute monitoring period.; The steady state we are examining is the number of 'carts-db' pods running, which should match the expected replica count of 2. The current state shows that the pod count consistently matches the expected count of 2 over multiple checks. Given that the system is expected to maintain 2 replicas, the threshold should ensure that at least 2 pods are running to maintain redundancy and availability. To account for potential fluctuations, such as during pod restarts or updates, a reasonable tolerance can be applied. For example, allowing a brief period where the pod count might drop to 1, but it should recover quickly. Therefore, the threshold can be defined as maintaining at least 2 'carts-db' pods running 95% of the time within a 1-minute monitoring period. This allows for brief fluctuations while ensuring the system remains stable and available.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestCartsDBPodCount(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.v1_apps = client.AppsV1Api()\n\n    def check_carts_db_pod_count(self, namespace, expected_count):\n        pod_count = 0\n        try:\n            resp = self.v1_apps.read_namespaced_deployment(name='carts-db', namespace=namespace)\n            pod_count = resp.status.replicas\n        except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n            print(f\"Exception when calling AppsV1Api->read_namespaced_deployment: {e}\")\n        return pod_count\n\n    def test_steady_state(self, duration):\n        namespace = 'sock-shop'\n        expected_count = 2\n        successful_checks = 0\n\n        for _ in range(duration):\n            pod_count = self.check_carts_db_pod_count(namespace, expected_count)\n            print(f\"Current 'carts-db' pod count: {pod_count}\")\n            if pod_count == expected_count:\n                successful_checks += 1\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the percentage of successful checks\n        success_percentage = (successful_checks / duration) * 100\n        print(f\"Success percentage: {success_percentage}%\")\n\n        # Assert that the success percentage is at least 95%\n        assert success_percentage >= 95, f\"Pod count was not stable enough: {success_percentage}% < 95%\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test carts-db pod count steady state.')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=60, help='Duration to check the pod count in seconds')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    test = TestCartsDBPodCount()\n    test.test_steady_state(args.duration)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\n```2nd steady states:\n- Name: front-end-pod-count\n- Description: The next issue to address is the 'Single Replica Deployment' in the 'front-end' Deployment. This is a critical issue because having only one replica can lead to downtime if the pod fails. To verify the steady state, we can measure the number of 'front-end' pods running, ensuring it matches the expected replica count of 1. This will help us understand if the pod is being scheduled correctly and remains available despite being a single replica. Monitoring the pod count will allow us to verify the system's resilience to potential failures.\n- Threshold for the steady state: At least 1 front-end pod must be running 95% of the time during a 1-minute monitoring period.; The current state of the system shows that the front-end pod count is consistently at 1, which matches the expected replica count as per the deployment configuration. Given that the system is currently stable with a single replica, the threshold should ensure that at least 1 front-end pod is running at all times. However, to account for potential fluctuations or brief disruptions, a reasonable tolerance should be included. Since the experiment must be completed within 1 minute, we can set a threshold that allows for a brief period where the pod count might temporarily drop below 1, but it should recover quickly. Therefore, the threshold can be defined as having at least 1 front-end pod running 95% of the time during the 1-minute monitoring period. This allows for a brief 3-second window where the pod count might be 0, but it should not persist beyond that.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestFrontEndPodCount(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self, namespace, duration):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.namespace = namespace\n        self.duration = duration\n\n    def test_front_end_pod_count(self):\n        pod_label_selector = 'name=front-end'\n        successful_checks = 0\n\n        # Check the pod count every second for the specified duration\n        for _ in range(self.duration):\n            pods = self.v1.list_namespaced_pod(namespace=self.namespace, label_selector=pod_label_selector)\n            pod_count = len(pods.items)\n            print(f'Current front-end pod count: {pod_count}')\n\n            # Increment successful checks if pod count is 1 or more\n            if pod_count >= 1:\n                successful_checks += 1\n\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the percentage of successful checks\n        success_rate = (successful_checks / self.duration) * 100\n        print(f'Success rate: {success_rate}%')\n\n        # Assert that the success rate meets the 95% threshold\n        assert success_rate >= 95, f\"Front-end pod count did not meet the 95% threshold.

This event will test the system's ability to maintain steady states under high demand. The system's weaknesses, such as missing resource requests and single replica deployments, can lead to potential downtime or degraded performance. To simulate this event, we will inject faults that target these weaknesses. First, we will use StressChaos to simulate high CPU and memory usage on the 'carts-db' pods, which lack resource requests, to see if they can maintain the required pod count. Next, we will use PodChaos to kill the single replica 'front-end' pod to test its resilience and recovery. Finally, we will introduce NetworkChaos to simulate network latency on the 'front-end' service, which will test the system's ability to handle network issues during high traffic. This sequence of fault injections will simulate the phenomena of a Black Friday sale, where high load, potential failures, and network issues are common.\n\n# Please follow the instructions below regarding Chaos Engineering as necessary:\n- The Chaos-Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute.\n\n- When using k6 in steady-state definition, always select a request URL from the following options (other requests are invalid):\n  1. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/\n  2. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/catalogue?size=10\n  3. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/detail.html?id=<ID>\n  Replace <ID> with an available ID: [`03fef6ac-1896-4ce8-bd69-b798f85c6e0b`, `3395a43e-2d88-40de-b95f-e00e1502085b`, `510a0d7e-8e83-4193-b483-e27e09ddc34d`, `808a2de1-1aaa-4c25-a9b9-6612e8f29a38`, `819e1fbf-8b7e-4f6d-811f-693534916a8b`, `837ab141-399e-4c1f-9abc-bace40296bac`, `a0a4f044-b040-410d-8ead-4de0446aec7e`, `d3588630-ad8e-49df-bbd7-3167f7efb246`, `zzz4f044-b040-410d-8ead-4de0446aec7e`]\n  4. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/category/\n  5. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/category?tags=<TAG>\n  Replace <TAG> with an available tag: [`magic`, `action`, `blue`, `brown`, `black`, `sport`, `formal`, `red`, `green`, `skin`, `geek`]\n  6. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/basket.html\n\nNow, please detail the post-validation phase.

            "{\"thought\":\"In the post-validation phase, we need to ensure that the system has returned to its steady states after the fault injection. Given the constraints of a 15-second total time for this phase, we will focus on quickly verifying the two defined steady states: 'carts-db-pod-count' and 'front-end-pod-count'.

                "System: You are a helpful AI assistant for Chaos Engineering.\nGiven a Chaos-Engineering-experiment plan, you will summarize it in detail according to the following rules:\n- In each phase, describe in detail the timeline for when each fault injection/unit test (for verifying steady-state) will be executed. For example, summarize which fault injections/unit tests will be executed simultaneously, and whether certain fault injections/unit tests will be executed at staggered timings. \n- Be sure to specify both each fault injection/unit test and their corresponding workflow names.\n- When explaining the timeline, provide a detailed description using specific values for duration, grace period, etc. Rephrase the specific values in a way that everyone can easily understand.\n- The meanings of each value are as follows:\n  - Grace Period: Time elapsed from the start of the current phase to the beginning of the fault injection/unit test.\n  - Duration: Duration of the fault injection/unit test. (grace_period + duration) should not exceed the corresponding phase's total time.\n- Never output bullet points.\n- The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"summary\": {\"title\": \"Summary\", \"description\": \"The summary of the given Chaos-Engineering-experiment plan.\", \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"required\": [\"summary\"]}\n```\n\nHuman: # Here is my Chaos-Engineering-experiment plan:\n## Time Schedule\nTo design a Chaos Engineering experiment that fits within the 1-minute constraint, we need to allocate time efficiently across the three phases: pre-validation, fault injection, and post-validation. Given the steady states and the fault scenario, we should ensure that each phase is long enough to gather meaningful data while staying within the total time limit. \n\n1. **Pre-validation Phase**: This phase is crucial to ensure that the system is in a steady state before we introduce any faults. We need to verify that the 'carts-db' and 'front-end' pods are running as expected. Given the 1-minute total time constraint, we can allocate 15 seconds for this phase. This should be sufficient to run the steady state checks for both 'carts-db' and 'front-end' pods, as the checks are designed to run quickly.\n\n2. **Fault Injection Phase**: This is the core of the experiment where we introduce the faults. We have three faults to inject: StressChaos on 'carts-db', PodChaos on 'front-end', and NetworkChaos on 'front-end'. We need to observe the system's behavior under these conditions. Allocating 30 seconds for this phase allows us to introduce each fault and observe the immediate impact on the system. This duration is a compromise between observing the effects and staying within the time limit.\n\n3. **Post-validation Phase**: After the faults are removed, we need to ensure that the system returns to its steady state. This phase should verify that the 'carts-db' and 'front-end' pods are back to their expected counts. Allocating 15 seconds for this phase allows us to run the steady state checks again to confirm recovery.\n\nIn summary, the time allocation is 15 seconds for pre-validation, 30 seconds for fault injection, and 15 seconds for post-validation, totaling 60 seconds.\n\n## Pre-validation Phase\nIn the pre-validation phase, we need to ensure that the system is in a steady state before we proceed with fault injection. This involves verifying that the key components of the system are operating as expected. Given the constraints of a 15-second total time for this phase, we need to efficiently schedule the unit tests to verify the steady states. \n\nThe two steady states we need to verify are:\n1. `carts-db-pod-count`: Ensure that at least 2 'carts-db' pods are running 95% of the time within a 1-minute monitoring period.\n2. `front-end-pod-count`: Ensure that at least 1 'front-end' pod is running 95% of the time during a 1-minute monitoring period.\n\nSince we only have 15 seconds for the pre-validation phase, we will perform a quick check to ensure that the current pod counts meet the expected values. This will not be a full 1-minute check but a snapshot to ensure that the system is in a steady state at the start of the experiment.\n\nThe approach is to run both unit tests simultaneously to maximize the use of the limited time. Each test will have a grace period of 0 seconds and a duration of 15 seconds, allowing us to quickly verify the current state of the system. This approach ensures that we can confirm the system's readiness for the chaos experiment within the given time constraint.\n- Verified Steady State #0: ```carts-db-pod-count```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```pre-unittest-carts-db-pod-count```  \n  - Grace Period: ```0s```  \n  - Duration: ```15s```  \n- Verified Steady State #1: ```front-end-pod-count```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```pre-unittest-front-end-pod-count```  \n  - Grace Period: ```0s```  \n  - Duration: ```15s```  \n\n\n## Fault-injection Phase \nIn this fault-injection phase, we aim to simulate a Black Friday sale scenario by introducing stress and disruptions to the system. The phase is designed to last 30 seconds, and we will inject three types of faults sequentially to observe the system's behavior under stress. The sequence and timing of the fault injections are crucial to effectively simulate the scenario and observe the system's resilience.\n\n1. **StressChaos on 'carts-db' Pods**: We will start by injecting a StressChaos fault targeting the 'carts-db' pods. This fault will simulate high CPU and memory usage, which is typical during a high-traffic event like Black Friday. The stress will be applied for 10 seconds, starting immediately at the beginning of the phase (grace period of 0s). This will help us observe if the 'carts-db' pods can maintain the required pod count despite the missing resource requests.\n\n2. **PodChaos on 'front-end' Pod**: After the StressChaos, we will introduce a PodChaos fault to kill the single replica 'front-end' pod. This fault will be injected at the 10-second mark (grace period of 10s) and will last for 10 seconds. This will test the system's ability to recover from a pod failure, especially since the 'front-end' deployment has only one replica.\n\n3. **NetworkChaos on 'front-end' Service**: Finally, we will inject a NetworkChaos fault to introduce network latency on the 'front-end' service. This fault will be injected at the 20-second mark (grace period of 20s) and will last for 10 seconds. This simulates network issues that might occur during high traffic, testing the system's ability to handle such disruptions.\n\nThe faults are injected sequentially to ensure that each fault's impact can be observed independently, while also simulating a realistic scenario where multiple issues might occur in quick succession during a high-demand event. The timing is staggered to allow for clear observation of each fault's effects and the system's response.\n\n\n- Injected Faults #0: ```StressChaos```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```fault-stresschaos```  \n  - Grace Period: ```0s```  \n  - Duration: ```10s```  \n- Injected Faults #1: ```PodChaos```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```fault-podchaos```  \n  - Grace Period: ```10s```  \n  - Duration: ```10s```  \n- Injected Faults #2: ```NetworkChaos```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```fault-networkchaos```  \n  - Grace Period: ```20s```  \n  - Duration: ```10s```  \n\n\n## Post-validation phase\nIn the post-validation phase, we need to ensure that the system has returned to its steady states after the fault injection. Given the constraints of a 15-second total time for this phase, we will focus on quickly verifying the two defined steady states: 'carts-db-pod-count' and 'front-end-pod-count'. The approach is to execute these unit tests simultaneously to maximize the use of the limited time available. Each unit test will have a short grace period to allow the system to stabilize after the fault injection, followed by a brief duration to verify the steady state. The thought process is to ensure that both critical components, 'carts-db' and 'front-end', are functioning as expected, which will indicate that the system has recovered from the injected faults.\n- Verified Steady State #0: ```carts-db-pod-count```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```post-unittest-carts-db-pod-count```  \n  - Grace Period: ```2s```  \n  - Duration: ```6s```  \n- Verified Steady State #1: ```front-end-pod-count```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```post-unittest-front-end-pod-count```  \n  - Grace Period: ```2s```  \n  - Duration: ```6s```  \n\n\nPlease summarize the above plan.\n\nAI: ```json\n{\"summary\":"
