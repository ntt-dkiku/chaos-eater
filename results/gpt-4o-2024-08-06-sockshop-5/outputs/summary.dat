The Chaos Engineering cycle for the 'sock-shop' system involved a detailed analysis and testing of the system's resilience under simulated fault conditions. The system is composed of multiple Kubernetes manifests that define various microservices, such as 'carts', 'catalogue', 'orders', 'payment', and 'user', each with associated deployments and services. The primary focus of the experiment was to address identified resiliency issues, including missing resource requests, single replica deployments, missing liveness and readiness probes, and hardcoded environment variables.

The experiment was structured into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation, each lasting 20 seconds, to fit within a total duration of 60 seconds. The pre-validation phase ensured that the system was in a steady state before any faults were injected. The fault-injection phase simulated a Black Friday sale scenario by introducing 'StressChaos' and 'PodChaos' faults to test the system's behavior under stress and potential failure conditions. The post-validation phase verified that the system returned to its steady state after the faults were removed.

The initial experiment revealed that while the 'carts-db' deployment maintained its steady state throughout, the 'front-end' deployment failed during the fault-injection and post-validation phases due to having only a single replica, which made it a single point of failure. This led to a recommendation to increase the number of replicas for the 'front-end' deployment to improve resilience.

After modifying the 'front-end' deployment to have two replicas, a second experiment was conducted. This time, all unit tests passed, indicating that the system successfully maintained its steady states during and after the fault-injection phase. The improvements ensured that the system could handle the simulated high-traffic event and recover from faults, demonstrating enhanced resilience and availability.
