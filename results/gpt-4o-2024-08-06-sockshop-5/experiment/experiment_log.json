The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"thought\": {\"title\": \"Thought\", \"describe\": \"Think about the total time and the reasonable time allocation for each phase that you are about to design, and explain your thought process in detail.\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"total_time\": {\"title\": \"Total Time\", \"description\": \"Total time of the entire chaos experiment. total_time should equal to the sum of pre_validation_time, fault_injection_time, and post_validation_time.\", \"example\": \"10m\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"pre_validation_time\": {\"title\": \"Pre Validation Time\", \"description\": \"Total time of validation before fault injection.\", \"example\": \"2m\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"fault_injection_time\": {\"title\": \"Fault Injection Time\", \"description\": \"Total time of fault injection.\", \"example\": \"6m\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"post_validation_time\": {\"title\": \"Post Validation Time\", \"description\": \"Total time of validation after fault injection.\", \"example\": \"2m\", \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"required\": [\"thought\", \"total_time\", \"pre_validation_time\", \"fault_injection_time\", \"post_validation_time\"]}\n```\nHuman: # Here is the overview of my system:\nThe system consists of the following K8s manifest(s):K8s manifest: sock-shop-2/manifests/00-sock-shop-ns.yaml\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Namespace\nmetadata:\n  name: sock-shop\n\n```\nSummary of sock-shop-2/manifests/00-sock-shop-ns.yaml:\n- This manifest defines a Kubernetes Namespace.\n- The Namespace is named 'sock-shop'.\n- Namespaces are used to organize and manage resources in a Kubernetes cluster.\n\nK8s manifest: sock-shop-2/manifests/01-carts-dep.yaml\n```yaml\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: carts\n  labels:\n    name: carts\n  namespace: sock-shop\nspec:\n  replicas: 2\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      name: carts\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        name: carts\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      -

It offers users the ability to browse a catalogue of socks, add items to a cart, place orders, and manage user accounts. The application is composed of multiple microservices, each responsible for a specific function, such as managing the product catalogue, handling user sessions, processing payments, and managing orders.; The manifests provided are part of a well-known microservices demo application called 'Sock Shop'. This application is designed to demonstrate the use of microservices architecture and Kubernetes orchestration. The application simulates an e-commerce website for selling socks, with various services such as carts, catalogue, orders, payment, and user management. The file names, labels, and Docker images used in the manifests (e.g., 'weaveworksdemos') are indicative of the Sock Shop application, which is a common reference application in the Kubernetes community.\n\n# Steady states of my system:\n2 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: carts-db-replicas\n- Description: The first issue to address is the 'Missing Resource Requests' for the 'carts-db' deployment. This is a critical issue because without resource requests, the pods may not get scheduled if the cluster is under resource pressure, leading to potential downtime. To ensure the system's steady state, we need to verify that the 'carts-db' deployment maintains the expected number of replicas, which is 2, even under resource constraints. This can be measured by checking the number of running pods for the 'carts-db' deployment.\n- Threshold for the steady state: At least 1 ready replica 100% of the time and 2 ready replicas at least 80% of the time during the monitoring period.; The steady state we are considering is the number of replicas for the 'carts-db' deployment. The current state shows that there are 2 total replicas and 2 ready replicas consistently over a period of 5 seconds. This indicates that the system is currently stable with all replicas being ready. Given that the deployment is configured to have 2 replicas, the threshold should ensure that both replicas are ready to maintain the steady state. To account for some fluctuations, we can set a tolerance that allows for a brief period where not all replicas are ready, but the system should recover quickly. A reasonable threshold would be to have at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time and both replicas ready at least 80% of the time during the monitoring period. This ensures that the system remains operational even if one replica temporarily becomes unavailable.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestCartsDBReplicas(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self, namespace='sock-shop', deployment_name='carts-db', duration=5):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.namespace = namespace\n        self.deployment_name = deployment_name\n        self.duration = duration\n        # Use the correct API client for deployments\n        self.apps_v1 = client.AppsV1Api()\n\n    def test_replicas_threshold(self):\n        # Initialize counters for ready replicas\n        total_checks = 0\n        ready_replicas_count = 0\n        fully_ready_replicas_count = 0\n\n        for _ in range(self.duration):\n            try:\n                # Read the deployment status using the correct API client\n                deployment = self.apps_v1.read_namespaced_deployment(self.deployment_name, self.namespace)\n                replicas = deployment.status.replicas\n                ready_replicas = deployment.status.ready_replicas\n                print(f\"Total replicas: {replicas}, Ready replicas: {ready_replicas}\")\n\n                # Increment the total checks\n                total_checks += 1\n\n                # Check if at least 1 replica is ready\n                if ready_replicas >= 1:\n                    ready_replicas_count += 1\n\n                # Check if both replicas are ready\n                if ready_replicas == 2:\n                    fully_ready_replicas_count += 1\n\n            except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n                print(f\"Exception when calling AppsV1Api->read_namespaced_deployment: {e}\")\n\n            # Wait for 1 second before the next check\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the percentage of time conditions are met\n        one_ready_percentage = (ready_replicas_count / total_checks) * 100\n        two_ready_percentage = (fully_ready_replicas_count / total_checks) * 100\n\n        # Assert the threshold conditions\n        assert one_ready_percentage == 100, \"At least 1 ready replica was not available 100% of the time.\"\n        assert two_ready_percentage >= 80, \"2 ready replicas were not available at least 80% of the time.\"\n\n        print(\"Test passed: Steady state conditions are satisfied.\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test carts-db replicas threshold')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=5, help='Duration to check the replicas')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    # Create an instance of the test class with the specified duration\n    test = TestCartsDBReplicas(duration=args.duration)\n    # Run the test\n    test.test_replicas_threshold()\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\n```2nd steady states:\n- Name: front-end-replica\n- Description: The next issue to address is the 'Single Replica Deployment' for the 'front-end' deployment. This is a critical issue because having only one replica can lead to downtime if the pod fails. To ensure the system's steady state, we need to verify that the 'front-end' deployment maintains at least one running pod at all times. This can be measured by checking the number of running pods for the 'front-end' deployment. Given that the deployment is configured to have only 1 replica, the threshold should ensure that this single replica is always ready to maintain the steady state. A reasonable threshold would be to have at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time during the monitoring period. This ensures that the system remains operational even if there are temporary issues with the pod.\n- Threshold for the steady state: At least 1 ready replica must be present 100% of the time during the monitoring period.; The steady state we are considering is the availability of the 'front-end' deployment, which currently has only one replica. The current state shows that the 'front-end' deployment has 1 ready replica consistently over a monitoring period of 5 seconds. To ensure the system remains operational, the threshold should be set such that the 'front-end' deployment maintains at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time during the monitoring period. This accounts for the fact that there is only one replica, and any downtime would mean the service is unavailable. Given the current state satisfies this condition, the threshold should be set to ensure that at least 1 ready replica is present 100% of the time during the monitoring period.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestFrontEndReplica(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self, namespace, deployment_name, duration):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.namespace = namespace\n        self.deployment_name = deployment_name\n        self.duration = duration\n        # Use AppsV1Api to interact with deployments\n        self.apps_v1 = client.AppsV1Api()\n\n    def test_steady_state(self):\n        ready_replicas_count = 0\n\n        # Loop for the specified duration\n        for _ in range(self.duration):\n            # Get the deployment status\n            resp = self.apps_v1.read_namespaced_deployment_status(self.deployment_name, self.namespace)\n            ready_replicas = resp.status.ready_replicas or 0\n            print(f\"Ready replicas for {self.deployment_name}: {ready_replicas}\")\n\n            # Check if the number of ready replicas is at least 1\n            if ready_replicas >= 1:\n                ready_replicas_count += 1\n\n            # Wait for 1 second before the next check\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the percentage of time the deployment was ready\n        readiness_percentage = (ready_replicas_count / self.duration) * 100\n        print(f\"{self.deployment_name} was ready {ready_replicas_count}/{self.duration} times.\")\n\n        # Assert that the deployment was ready 100% of the time\n        assert readiness_percentage == 100, f\"{self.deployment_name} readiness was {readiness_percentage}%, expected 100%.\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test front-end replica readiness')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=5, help='Duration to check the replicas')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    # Create a test instance and run the test\n    test = TestFrontEndReplica('sock-shop', 'front-end', args.duration)\n    test.test_steady_state()\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n# A fault scenario that may occur in my system and may affect the steady states:\n\nAn assumed fault scenario is as follows:\n- Event: Black Friday Sale\n- Used Chaos Engineering tool: Chaos Mesh\n- Faults to simulate the event: [[Fault(name='StressChaos', name_id=0, params={'mode': 'all', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['sock-shop'], 'labelSelectors': {'name': 'carts-db'}}, 'stressors': {'cpu': {'workers': 2, 'load': 80}}, 'containerNames': ['carts-db']})], [Fault(name='PodChaos', name_id=0, params={'action': 'pod-kill', 'mode': 'one', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['sock-shop'], 'labelSelectors': {'name': 'front-end'}}, 'value': '1'})]]\n- Description: During a Black Friday sale, the system is expected to handle a significant increase in traffic, which can stress the system's resources and reveal weaknesses. The 'carts-db' deployment lacks resource requests, which can lead to scheduling issues under resource pressure. The 'front-end' deployment has only one replica, making it a single point of failure. To simulate the Black Friday event, we will first inject a 'StressChaos' fault to simulate high CPU usage on the 'carts-db' pods, testing if the system can maintain the steady state of having at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time and 2 ready replicas 80% of the time. Next, we will inject a 'PodChaos' fault to kill the 'front-end' pod, testing if the system can maintain the steady state of having at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time. This sequence simulates the increased load and potential failures during a high-traffic event like Black Friday.\n\n# Please follow the instructions below regarding Chaos Engineering as necessary:\n- The Chaos-Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute.\n- When using k6 in steady-state definition, always select a request URL from the following options (other requests are invalid):\n  1. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/\n  2. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/catalogue?size=10\n  3. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/detail.html?id=<ID>\n  Replace <ID> with an available ID: [`03fef6ac-1896-4ce8-bd69-b798f85c6e0b`, `3395a43e-2d88-40de-b95f-e00e1502085b`, `510a0d7e-8e83-4193-b483-e27e09ddc34d`, `808a2de1-1aaa-4c25-a9b9-6612e8f29a38`, `819e1fbf-8b7e-4f6d-811f-693534916a8b`, `837ab141-399e-4c1f-9abc-bace40296bac`, `a0a4f044-b040-410d-8ead-4de0446aec7e`, `d3588630-ad8e-49df-bbd7-3167f7efb246`, `zzz4f044-b040-410d-8ead-4de0446aec7e`]\n  4. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/category/\n  5. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/category?tags=<TAG>\n  Replace <TAG> with an available tag: [`magic`, `action`, `blue`, `brown`, `black`, `sport`, `formal`, `red`, `green`, `skin`, `geek`]\n  6. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/basket.html\n\nNow, please plan a Chaos Engineering experiment to check the network system's resiliency that the steady states are remained during fault injection.\nAI: ```json\n{\"thought\":"

It offers users the ability to browse a catalogue of socks, add items to a cart, place orders, and manage user accounts. The application is composed of multiple microservices, each responsible for a specific function, such as managing the product catalogue, handling user sessions, processing payments, and managing orders.; The manifests provided are part of a well-known microservices demo application called 'Sock Shop'. This application is designed to demonstrate the use of microservices architecture and Kubernetes orchestration. The application simulates an e-commerce website for selling socks, with various services such as carts, catalogue, orders, payment, and user management. The file names, labels, and Docker images used in the manifests (e.g., 'weaveworksdemos') are indicative of the Sock Shop application, which is a common reference application in the Kubernetes community.\n\n# Steady states of my system:\n2 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: carts-db-replicas\n- Description: The first issue to address is the 'Missing Resource Requests' for the 'carts-db' deployment. This is a critical issue because without resource requests, the pods may not get scheduled if the cluster is under resource pressure, leading to potential downtime. To ensure the system's steady state, we need to verify that the 'carts-db' deployment maintains the expected number of replicas, which is 2, even under resource constraints. This can be measured by checking the number of running pods for the 'carts-db' deployment.\n- Threshold for the steady state: At least 1 ready replica 100% of the time and 2 ready replicas at least 80% of the time during the monitoring period.; The steady state we are considering is the number of replicas for the 'carts-db' deployment. The current state shows that there are 2 total replicas and 2 ready replicas consistently over a period of 5 seconds. This indicates that the system is currently stable with all replicas being ready. Given that the deployment is configured to have 2 replicas, the threshold should ensure that both replicas are ready to maintain the steady state. To account for some fluctuations, we can set a tolerance that allows for a brief period where not all replicas are ready, but the system should recover quickly. A reasonable threshold would be to have at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time and both replicas ready at least 80% of the time during the monitoring period. This ensures that the system remains operational even if one replica temporarily becomes unavailable.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestCartsDBReplicas(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self, namespace='sock-shop', deployment_name='carts-db', duration=5):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.namespace = namespace\n        self.deployment_name = deployment_name\n        self.duration = duration\n        # Use the correct API client for deployments\n        self.apps_v1 = client.AppsV1Api()\n\n    def test_replicas_threshold(self):\n        # Initialize counters for ready replicas\n        total_checks = 0\n        ready_replicas_count = 0\n        fully_ready_replicas_count = 0\n\n        for _ in range(self.duration):\n            try:\n                # Read the deployment status using the correct API client\n                deployment = self.apps_v1.read_namespaced_deployment(self.deployment_name, self.namespace)\n                replicas = deployment.status.replicas\n                ready_replicas = deployment.status.ready_replicas\n                print(f\"Total replicas: {replicas}, Ready replicas: {ready_replicas}\")\n\n                # Increment the total checks\n                total_checks += 1\n\n                # Check if at least 1 replica is ready\n                if ready_replicas >= 1:\n                    ready_replicas_count += 1\n\n                # Check if both replicas are ready\n                if ready_replicas == 2:\n                    fully_ready_replicas_count += 1\n\n            except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n                print(f\"Exception when calling AppsV1Api->read_namespaced_deployment: {e}\")\n\n            # Wait for 1 second before the next check\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the percentage of time conditions are met\n        one_ready_percentage = (ready_replicas_count / total_checks) * 100\n        two_ready_percentage = (fully_ready_replicas_count / total_checks) * 100\n\n        # Assert the threshold conditions\n        assert one_ready_percentage == 100, \"At least 1 ready replica was not available 100% of the time.\"\n        assert two_ready_percentage >= 80, \"2 ready replicas were not available at least 80% of the time.\"\n\n        print(\"Test passed: Steady state conditions are satisfied.\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test carts-db replicas threshold')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=5, help='Duration to check the replicas')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    # Create an instance of the test class with the specified duration\n    test = TestCartsDBReplicas(duration=args.duration)\n    # Run the test\n    test.test_replicas_threshold()\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\n```2nd steady states:\n- Name: front-end-replica\n- Description: The next issue to address is the 'Single Replica Deployment' for the 'front-end' deployment. This is a critical issue because having only one replica can lead to downtime if the pod fails. To ensure the system's steady state, we need to verify that the 'front-end' deployment maintains at least one running pod at all times. This can be measured by checking the number of running pods for the 'front-end' deployment. Given that the deployment is configured to have only 1 replica, the threshold should ensure that this single replica is always ready to maintain the steady state. A reasonable threshold would be to have at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time during the monitoring period. This ensures that the system remains operational even if there are temporary issues with the pod.\n- Threshold for the steady state: At least 1 ready replica must be present 100% of the time during the monitoring period.; The steady state we are considering is the availability of the 'front-end' deployment, which currently has only one replica. The current state shows that the 'front-end' deployment has 1 ready replica consistently over a monitoring period of 5 seconds. To ensure the system remains operational, the threshold should be set such that the 'front-end' deployment maintains at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time during the monitoring period. This accounts for the fact that there is only one replica, and any downtime would mean the service is unavailable. Given the current state satisfies this condition, the threshold should be set to ensure that at least 1 ready replica is present 100% of the time during the monitoring period.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestFrontEndReplica(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self, namespace, deployment_name, duration):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.namespace = namespace\n        self.deployment_name = deployment_name\n        self.duration = duration\n        # Use AppsV1Api to interact with deployments\n        self.apps_v1 = client.AppsV1Api()\n\n    def test_steady_state(self):\n        ready_replicas_count = 0\n\n        # Loop for the specified duration\n        for _ in range(self.duration):\n            # Get the deployment status\n            resp = self.apps_v1.read_namespaced_deployment_status(self.deployment_name, self.namespace)\n            ready_replicas = resp.status.ready_replicas or 0\n            print(f\"Ready replicas for {self.deployment_name}: {ready_replicas}\")\n\n            # Check if the number of ready replicas is at least 1\n            if ready_replicas >= 1:\n                ready_replicas_count += 1\n\n            # Wait for 1 second before the next check\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the percentage of time the deployment was ready\n        readiness_percentage = (ready_replicas_count / self.duration) * 100\n        print(f\"{self.deployment_name} was ready {ready_replicas_count}/{self.duration} times.\")\n\n        # Assert that the deployment was ready 100% of the time\n        assert readiness_percentage == 100, f\"{self.deployment_name} readiness was {readiness_percentage}%, expected 100%.\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test front-end replica readiness')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=5, help='Duration to check the replicas')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    # Create a test instance and run the test\n    test = TestFrontEndReplica('sock-shop', 'front-end', args.duration)\n    test.test_steady_state()\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n# A fault scenario that may occur in my system and may affect the steady states:\n\nAn assumed fault scenario is as follows:\n- Event: Black Friday Sale\n- Used Chaos Engineering tool: Chaos Mesh\n- Faults to simulate the event: [[Fault(name='StressChaos', name_id=0, params={'mode': 'all', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['sock-shop'], 'labelSelectors': {'name': 'carts-db'}}, 'stressors': {'cpu': {'workers': 2, 'load': 80}}, 'containerNames': ['carts-db']})], [Fault(name='PodChaos', name_id=0, params={'action': 'pod-kill', 'mode': 'one', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['sock-shop'], 'labelSelectors': {'name': 'front-end'}}, 'value': '1'})]]\n- Description: During a Black Friday sale, the system is expected to handle a significant increase in traffic, which can stress the system's resources and reveal weaknesses. The 'carts-db' deployment lacks resource requests, which can lead to scheduling issues under resource pressure. The 'front-end' deployment has only one replica, making it a single point of failure. To simulate the Black Friday event, we will first inject a 'StressChaos' fault to simulate high CPU usage on the 'carts-db' pods, testing if the system can maintain the steady state of having at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time and 2 ready replicas 80% of the time. Next, we will inject a 'PodChaos' fault to kill the 'front-end' pod, testing if the system can maintain the steady state of having at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time. This sequence simulates the increased load and potential failures during a high-traffic event like Black Friday.\n\n# Please follow the instructions below regarding Chaos Engineering as necessary:\n- The Chaos-Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute.\n- When using k6 in steady-state definition, always select a request URL from the following options (other requests are invalid):\n  1. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/\n  2. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/catalogue?size=10\n  3. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/detail.html?id=<ID>\n  Replace <ID> with an available ID: [`03fef6ac-1896-4ce8-bd69-b798f85c6e0b`, `3395a43e-2d88-40de-b95f-e00e1502085b`, `510a0d7e-8e83-4193-b483-e27e09ddc34d`, `808a2de1-1aaa-4c25-a9b9-6612e8f29a38`, `819e1fbf-8b7e-4f6d-811f-693534916a8b`, `837ab141-399e-4c1f-9abc-bace40296bac`, `a0a4f044-b040-410d-8ead-4de0446aec7e`, `d3588630-ad8e-49df-bbd7-3167f7efb246`, `zzz4f044-b040-410d-8ead-4de0446aec7e`]\n  4. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/category/\n  5. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/category?tags=<TAG>\n  Replace <TAG> with an available tag: [`magic`, `action`, `blue`, `brown`, `black`, `sport`, `formal`, `red`, `green`, `skin`, `geek`]\n  6. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/basket.html\n\nNow, please detail the pre-validation phase.

It offers users the ability to browse a catalogue of socks, add items to a cart, place orders, and manage user accounts. The application is composed of multiple microservices, each responsible for a specific function, such as managing the product catalogue, handling user sessions, processing payments, and managing orders.; The manifests provided are part of a well-known microservices demo application called 'Sock Shop'. This application is designed to demonstrate the use of microservices architecture and Kubernetes orchestration. The application simulates an e-commerce website for selling socks, with various services such as carts, catalogue, orders, payment, and user management. The file names, labels, and Docker images used in the manifests (e.g., 'weaveworksdemos') are indicative of the Sock Shop application, which is a common reference application in the Kubernetes community.\n\n# Steady states of my system:\n2 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: carts-db-replicas\n- Description: The first issue to address is the 'Missing Resource Requests' for the 'carts-db' deployment. This is a critical issue because without resource requests, the pods may not get scheduled if the cluster is under resource pressure, leading to potential downtime. To ensure the system's steady state, we need to verify that the 'carts-db' deployment maintains the expected number of replicas, which is 2, even under resource constraints. This can be measured by checking the number of running pods for the 'carts-db' deployment.\n- Threshold for the steady state: At least 1 ready replica 100% of the time and 2 ready replicas at least 80% of the time during the monitoring period.; The steady state we are considering is the number of replicas for the 'carts-db' deployment. The current state shows that there are 2 total replicas and 2 ready replicas consistently over a period of 5 seconds. This indicates that the system is currently stable with all replicas being ready. Given that the deployment is configured to have 2 replicas, the threshold should ensure that both replicas are ready to maintain the steady state. To account for some fluctuations, we can set a tolerance that allows for a brief period where not all replicas are ready, but the system should recover quickly. A reasonable threshold would be to have at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time and both replicas ready at least 80% of the time during the monitoring period. This ensures that the system remains operational even if one replica temporarily becomes unavailable.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestCartsDBReplicas(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self, namespace='sock-shop', deployment_name='carts-db', duration=5):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.namespace = namespace\n        self.deployment_name = deployment_name\n        self.duration = duration\n        # Use the correct API client for deployments\n        self.apps_v1 = client.AppsV1Api()\n\n    def test_replicas_threshold(self):\n        # Initialize counters for ready replicas\n        total_checks = 0\n        ready_replicas_count = 0\n        fully_ready_replicas_count = 0\n\n        for _ in range(self.duration):\n            try:\n                # Read the deployment status using the correct API client\n                deployment = self.apps_v1.read_namespaced_deployment(self.deployment_name, self.namespace)\n                replicas = deployment.status.replicas\n                ready_replicas = deployment.status.ready_replicas\n                print(f\"Total replicas: {replicas}, Ready replicas: {ready_replicas}\")\n\n                # Increment the total checks\n                total_checks += 1\n\n                # Check if at least 1 replica is ready\n                if ready_replicas >= 1:\n                    ready_replicas_count += 1\n\n                # Check if both replicas are ready\n                if ready_replicas == 2:\n                    fully_ready_replicas_count += 1\n\n            except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n                print(f\"Exception when calling AppsV1Api->read_namespaced_deployment: {e}\")\n\n            # Wait for 1 second before the next check\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the percentage of time conditions are met\n        one_ready_percentage = (ready_replicas_count / total_checks) * 100\n        two_ready_percentage = (fully_ready_replicas_count / total_checks) * 100\n\n        # Assert the threshold conditions\n        assert one_ready_percentage == 100, \"At least 1 ready replica was not available 100% of the time.\"\n        assert two_ready_percentage >= 80, \"2 ready replicas were not available at least 80% of the time.\"\n\n        print(\"Test passed: Steady state conditions are satisfied.\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test carts-db replicas threshold')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=5, help='Duration to check the replicas')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    # Create an instance of the test class with the specified duration\n    test = TestCartsDBReplicas(duration=args.duration)\n    # Run the test\n    test.test_replicas_threshold()\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\n```2nd steady states:\n- Name: front-end-replica\n- Description: The next issue to address is the 'Single Replica Deployment' for the 'front-end' deployment. This is a critical issue because having only one replica can lead to downtime if the pod fails. To ensure the system's steady state, we need to verify that the 'front-end' deployment maintains at least one running pod at all times. This can be measured by checking the number of running pods for the 'front-end' deployment. Given that the deployment is configured to have only 1 replica, the threshold should ensure that this single replica is always ready to maintain the steady state. A reasonable threshold would be to have at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time during the monitoring period. This ensures that the system remains operational even if there are temporary issues with the pod.\n- Threshold for the steady state: At least 1 ready replica must be present 100% of the time during the monitoring period.; The steady state we are considering is the availability of the 'front-end' deployment, which currently has only one replica. The current state shows that the 'front-end' deployment has 1 ready replica consistently over a monitoring period of 5 seconds. To ensure the system remains operational, the threshold should be set such that the 'front-end' deployment maintains at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time during the monitoring period. This accounts for the fact that there is only one replica, and any downtime would mean the service is unavailable. Given the current state satisfies this condition, the threshold should be set to ensure that at least 1 ready replica is present 100% of the time during the monitoring period.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestFrontEndReplica(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self, namespace, deployment_name, duration):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.namespace = namespace\n        self.deployment_name = deployment_name\n        self.duration = duration\n        # Use AppsV1Api to interact with deployments\n        self.apps_v1 = client.AppsV1Api()\n\n    def test_steady_state(self):\n        ready_replicas_count = 0\n\n        # Loop for the specified duration\n        for _ in range(self.duration):\n            # Get the deployment status\n            resp = self.apps_v1.read_namespaced_deployment_status(self.deployment_name, self.namespace)\n            ready_replicas = resp.status.ready_replicas or 0\n            print(f\"Ready replicas for {self.deployment_name}: {ready_replicas}\")\n\n            # Check if the number of ready replicas is at least 1\n            if ready_replicas >= 1:\n                ready_replicas_count += 1\n\n            # Wait for 1 second before the next check\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the percentage of time the deployment was ready\n        readiness_percentage = (ready_replicas_count / self.duration) * 100\n        print(f\"{self.deployment_name} was ready {ready_replicas_count}/{self.duration} times.\")\n\n        # Assert that the deployment was ready 100% of the time\n        assert readiness_percentage == 100, f\"{self.deployment_name} readiness was {readiness_percentage}%, expected 100%.\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test front-end replica readiness')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=5, help='Duration to check the replicas')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    # Create a test instance and run the test\n    test = TestFrontEndReplica('sock-shop', 'front-end', args.duration)\n    test.test_steady_state()\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n# A fault scenario that may occur in my system and may affect the steady states:\n\nAn assumed fault scenario is as follows:\n- Event: Black Friday Sale\n- Used Chaos Engineering tool: Chaos Mesh\n- Faults to simulate the event: [[Fault(name='StressChaos', name_id=0, params={'mode': 'all', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['sock-shop'], 'labelSelectors': {'name': 'carts-db'}}, 'stressors': {'cpu': {'workers': 2, 'load': 80}}, 'containerNames': ['carts-db']})], [Fault(name='PodChaos', name_id=0, params={'action': 'pod-kill', 'mode': 'one', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['sock-shop'], 'labelSelectors': {'name': 'front-end'}}, 'value': '1'})]]\n- Description: During a Black Friday sale, the system is expected to handle a significant increase in traffic, which can stress the system's resources and reveal weaknesses. The 'carts-db' deployment lacks resource requests, which can lead to scheduling issues under resource pressure. The 'front-end' deployment has only one replica, making it a single point of failure. To simulate the Black Friday event, we will first inject a 'StressChaos' fault to simulate high CPU usage on the 'carts-db' pods, testing if the system can maintain the steady state of having at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time and 2 ready replicas 80% of the time. Next, we will inject a 'PodChaos' fault to kill the 'front-end' pod, testing if the system can maintain the steady state of having at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time. This sequence simulates the increased load and potential failures during a high-traffic event like Black Friday.\n\n# Please follow the instructions below regarding Chaos Engineering as necessary:\n- The Chaos-Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute.\n- When using k6 in steady-state definition, always select a request URL from the following options (other requests are invalid):\n  1. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/\n  2. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/catalogue?size=10\n  3. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/detail.html?id=<ID>\n  Replace <ID> with an available ID: [`03fef6ac-1896-4ce8-bd69-b798f85c6e0b`, `3395a43e-2d88-40de-b95f-e00e1502085b`, `510a0d7e-8e83-4193-b483-e27e09ddc34d`, `808a2de1-1aaa-4c25-a9b9-6612e8f29a38`, `819e1fbf-8b7e-4f6d-811f-693534916a8b`, `837ab141-399e-4c1f-9abc-bace40296bac`, `a0a4f044-b040-410d-8ead-4de0446aec7e`, `d3588630-ad8e-49df-bbd7-3167f7efb246`, `zzz4f044-b040-410d-8ead-4de0446aec7e`]\n  4. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/category/\n  5. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/category?tags=<TAG>\n  Replace <TAG> with an available tag: [`magic`, `action`, `blue`, `brown`, `black`, `sport`, `formal`, `red`, `green`, `skin`, `geek`]\n  6. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/basket.html\n\nNow, please detail the fault-injection phase.

It offers users the ability to browse a catalogue of socks, add items to a cart, place orders, and manage user accounts. The application is composed of multiple microservices, each responsible for a specific function, such as managing the product catalogue, handling user sessions, processing payments, and managing orders.; The manifests provided are part of a well-known microservices demo application called 'Sock Shop'. This application is designed to demonstrate the use of microservices architecture and Kubernetes orchestration. The application simulates an e-commerce website for selling socks, with various services such as carts, catalogue, orders, payment, and user management. The file names, labels, and Docker images used in the manifests (e.g., 'weaveworksdemos') are indicative of the Sock Shop application, which is a common reference application in the Kubernetes community.\n\n# Steady states of my system:\n2 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: carts-db-replicas\n- Description: The first issue to address is the 'Missing Resource Requests' for the 'carts-db' deployment. This is a critical issue because without resource requests, the pods may not get scheduled if the cluster is under resource pressure, leading to potential downtime. To ensure the system's steady state, we need to verify that the 'carts-db' deployment maintains the expected number of replicas, which is 2, even under resource constraints. This can be measured by checking the number of running pods for the 'carts-db' deployment.\n- Threshold for the steady state: At least 1 ready replica 100% of the time and 2 ready replicas at least 80% of the time during the monitoring period.; The steady state we are considering is the number of replicas for the 'carts-db' deployment. The current state shows that there are 2 total replicas and 2 ready replicas consistently over a period of 5 seconds. This indicates that the system is currently stable with all replicas being ready. Given that the deployment is configured to have 2 replicas, the threshold should ensure that both replicas are ready to maintain the steady state. To account for some fluctuations, we can set a tolerance that allows for a brief period where not all replicas are ready, but the system should recover quickly. A reasonable threshold would be to have at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time and both replicas ready at least 80% of the time during the monitoring period. This ensures that the system remains operational even if one replica temporarily becomes unavailable.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestCartsDBReplicas(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self, namespace='sock-shop', deployment_name='carts-db', duration=5):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.namespace = namespace\n        self.deployment_name = deployment_name\n        self.duration = duration\n        # Use the correct API client for deployments\n        self.apps_v1 = client.AppsV1Api()\n\n    def test_replicas_threshold(self):\n        # Initialize counters for ready replicas\n        total_checks = 0\n        ready_replicas_count = 0\n        fully_ready_replicas_count = 0\n\n        for _ in range(self.duration):\n            try:\n                # Read the deployment status using the correct API client\n                deployment = self.apps_v1.read_namespaced_deployment(self.deployment_name, self.namespace)\n                replicas = deployment.status.replicas\n                ready_replicas = deployment.status.ready_replicas\n                print(f\"Total replicas: {replicas}, Ready replicas: {ready_replicas}\")\n\n                # Increment the total checks\n                total_checks += 1\n\n                # Check if at least 1 replica is ready\n                if ready_replicas >= 1:\n                    ready_replicas_count += 1\n\n                # Check if both replicas are ready\n                if ready_replicas == 2:\n                    fully_ready_replicas_count += 1\n\n            except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n                print(f\"Exception when calling AppsV1Api->read_namespaced_deployment: {e}\")\n\n            # Wait for 1 second before the next check\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the percentage of time conditions are met\n        one_ready_percentage = (ready_replicas_count / total_checks) * 100\n        two_ready_percentage = (fully_ready_replicas_count / total_checks) * 100\n\n        # Assert the threshold conditions\n        assert one_ready_percentage == 100, \"At least 1 ready replica was not available 100% of the time.\"\n        assert two_ready_percentage >= 80, \"2 ready replicas were not available at least 80% of the time.\"\n\n        print(\"Test passed: Steady state conditions are satisfied.\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test carts-db replicas threshold')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=5, help='Duration to check the replicas')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    # Create an instance of the test class with the specified duration\n    test = TestCartsDBReplicas(duration=args.duration)\n    # Run the test\n    test.test_replicas_threshold()\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\n```2nd steady states:\n- Name: front-end-replica\n- Description: The next issue to address is the 'Single Replica Deployment' for the 'front-end' deployment. This is a critical issue because having only one replica can lead to downtime if the pod fails. To ensure the system's steady state, we need to verify that the 'front-end' deployment maintains at least one running pod at all times. This can be measured by checking the number of running pods for the 'front-end' deployment. Given that the deployment is configured to have only 1 replica, the threshold should ensure that this single replica is always ready to maintain the steady state. A reasonable threshold would be to have at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time during the monitoring period. This ensures that the system remains operational even if there are temporary issues with the pod.\n- Threshold for the steady state: At least 1 ready replica must be present 100% of the time during the monitoring period.; The steady state we are considering is the availability of the 'front-end' deployment, which currently has only one replica. The current state shows that the 'front-end' deployment has 1 ready replica consistently over a monitoring period of 5 seconds. To ensure the system remains operational, the threshold should be set such that the 'front-end' deployment maintains at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time during the monitoring period. This accounts for the fact that there is only one replica, and any downtime would mean the service is unavailable. Given the current state satisfies this condition, the threshold should be set to ensure that at least 1 ready replica is present 100% of the time during the monitoring period.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestFrontEndReplica(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self, namespace, deployment_name, duration):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.namespace = namespace\n        self.deployment_name = deployment_name\n        self.duration = duration\n        # Use AppsV1Api to interact with deployments\n        self.apps_v1 = client.AppsV1Api()\n\n    def test_steady_state(self):\n        ready_replicas_count = 0\n\n        # Loop for the specified duration\n        for _ in range(self.duration):\n            # Get the deployment status\n            resp = self.apps_v1.read_namespaced_deployment_status(self.deployment_name, self.namespace)\n            ready_replicas = resp.status.ready_replicas or 0\n            print(f\"Ready replicas for {self.deployment_name}: {ready_replicas}\")\n\n            # Check if the number of ready replicas is at least 1\n            if ready_replicas >= 1:\n                ready_replicas_count += 1\n\n            # Wait for 1 second before the next check\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the percentage of time the deployment was ready\n        readiness_percentage = (ready_replicas_count / self.duration) * 100\n        print(f\"{self.deployment_name} was ready {ready_replicas_count}/{self.duration} times.\")\n\n        # Assert that the deployment was ready 100% of the time\n        assert readiness_percentage == 100, f\"{self.deployment_name} readiness was {readiness_percentage}%, expected 100%.\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test front-end replica readiness')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=5, help='Duration to check the replicas')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    # Create a test instance and run the test\n    test = TestFrontEndReplica('sock-shop', 'front-end', args.duration)\n    test.test_steady_state()\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n# A fault scenario that may occur in my system and may affect the steady states:\n\nAn assumed fault scenario is as follows:\n- Event: Black Friday Sale\n- Used Chaos Engineering tool: Chaos Mesh\n- Faults to simulate the event: [[Fault(name='StressChaos', name_id=0, params={'mode': 'all', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['sock-shop'], 'labelSelectors': {'name': 'carts-db'}}, 'stressors': {'cpu': {'workers': 2, 'load': 80}}, 'containerNames': ['carts-db']})], [Fault(name='PodChaos', name_id=0, params={'action': 'pod-kill', 'mode': 'one', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['sock-shop'], 'labelSelectors': {'name': 'front-end'}}, 'value': '1'})]]\n- Description: During a Black Friday sale, the system is expected to handle a significant increase in traffic, which can stress the system's resources and reveal weaknesses. The 'carts-db' deployment lacks resource requests, which can lead to scheduling issues under resource pressure. The 'front-end' deployment has only one replica, making it a single point of failure. To simulate the Black Friday event, we will first inject a 'StressChaos' fault to simulate high CPU usage on the 'carts-db' pods, testing if the system can maintain the steady state of having at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time and 2 ready replicas 80% of the time. Next, we will inject a 'PodChaos' fault to kill the 'front-end' pod, testing if the system can maintain the steady state of having at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time. This sequence simulates the increased load and potential failures during a high-traffic event like Black Friday.\n\n# Please follow the instructions below regarding Chaos Engineering as necessary:\n- The Chaos-Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute.\n- When using k6 in steady-state definition, always select a request URL from the following options (other requests are invalid):\n  1. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/\n  2. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/catalogue?size=10\n  3. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/detail.html?id=<ID>\n  Replace <ID> with an available ID: [`03fef6ac-1896-4ce8-bd69-b798f85c6e0b`, `3395a43e-2d88-40de-b95f-e00e1502085b`, `510a0d7e-8e83-4193-b483-e27e09ddc34d`, `808a2de1-1aaa-4c25-a9b9-6612e8f29a38`, `819e1fbf-8b7e-4f6d-811f-693534916a8b`, `837ab141-399e-4c1f-9abc-bace40296bac`, `a0a4f044-b040-410d-8ead-4de0446aec7e`, `d3588630-ad8e-49df-bbd7-3167f7efb246`, `zzz4f044-b040-410d-8ead-4de0446aec7e`]\n  4. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/category/\n  5. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/category?tags=<TAG>\n  Replace <TAG> with an available tag: [`magic`, `action`, `blue`, `brown`, `black`, `sport`, `formal`, `red`, `green`, `skin`, `geek`]\n  6. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/basket.html\n\nNow, please detail the post-validation phase.

Given the constraints, the experiment must be completed within 1 minute. The experiment is divided into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation. \n\n1. **Pre-validation Phase**: This phase ensures that the system is in a steady state before any faults are injected. We will allocate 20 seconds for this phase. During this time, we will verify that the 'carts-db' deployment maintains at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time and 2 ready replicas 80% of the time, and that the 'front-end' deployment maintains at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time.\n\n2. **Fault-injection Phase**: This phase involves injecting faults to simulate the Black Friday event. We will allocate 20 seconds for this phase. The faults include a 'StressChaos' fault to simulate high CPU usage on the 'carts-db' pods and a 'PodChaos' fault to kill the 'front-end' pod. These faults will test the system's ability to maintain the defined steady states under stress and failure conditions.\n\n3. **Post-validation Phase**: This phase ensures that the system returns to its steady state after the faults are removed. We will allocate 20 seconds for this phase. During this time, we will again verify the steady states for the 'carts-db' and 'front-end' deployments to ensure they meet the defined thresholds.\n\nThe total time for the experiment is 60 seconds, with each phase receiving an equal allocation of 20 seconds. This allocation allows for a balanced approach to validating the system's steady state, injecting faults, and confirming recovery.\n\n## Pre-validation Phase\nIn the pre-validation phase, we need to ensure that the system is in a steady state before we introduce any faults. This involves verifying that the current state of the system meets the defined steady state thresholds. Given the constraints of a 20-second total time for this phase, we will execute the unit tests for both steady states simultaneously to maximize efficiency. The first steady state, 'carts-db-replicas', requires checking that at least 1 replica is ready 100% of the time and 2 replicas are ready at least 80% of the time. The second steady state, 'front-end-replica', requires ensuring that the single replica is ready 100% of the time. Both tests will run for the full 20 seconds, with checks occurring every second. This approach ensures that we have sufficient data to confirm the system's readiness before proceeding to the fault injection phase.\n- Verified Steady State #0: ```carts-db-replicas```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```pre-unittest-carts-db-replicas```  \n  - Grace Period: ```0s```  \n  - Duration: ```20s```  \n- Verified Steady State #1: ```front-end-replica```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```pre-unittest-front-end-replica```  \n  - Grace Period: ```0s```  \n  - Duration: ```20s```  \n\n\n## Fault-injection Phase \nIn this fault-injection phase, we aim to simulate a Black Friday sale scenario by introducing two types of faults: 'StressChaos' and 'PodChaos'. The goal is to observe how the system behaves under stress and potential failure conditions. The phase is limited to 20 seconds, so we need to carefully time the injections and tests to fit within this window.\n\nFirst, we will inject a 'StressChaos' fault on the 'carts-db' deployment to simulate high CPU usage. This will help us test the system's ability to maintain the steady state of having at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time and 2 ready replicas 80% of the time. We will start this fault injection immediately at the beginning of the phase and let it run for 10 seconds.\n\nSimultaneously, we will run the unit test for the 'carts-db-replicas' steady state to verify if the system can maintain the required number of ready replicas during the stress period. This test will also start at the beginning of the phase and run for 10 seconds.\n\nNext, we will inject a 'PodChaos' fault to kill the 'front-end' pod. This will test the system's ability to maintain the steady state of having at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time for the 'front-end' deployment. We will start this fault injection at the 10-second mark and let it run for 5 seconds.\n\nFinally, we will run the unit test for the 'front-end-replica' steady state to verify if the system can maintain the required readiness during the pod failure. This test will start at the 10-second mark and run for 5 seconds.\n\nBy staggering the fault injections and unit tests in this manner, we can effectively simulate the Black Friday scenario and assess the system's resilience under stress and failure conditions.\n- Verified Steady State #0: ```carts-db-replicas```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```fault-unittest-carts-db-replicas```  \n  - Grace Period: ```0s```  \n  - Duration: ```10s```  \n- Verified Steady State #1: ```front-end-replica```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```fault-unittest-front-end-replica```  \n  - Grace Period: ```10s```  \n  - Duration: ```5s```  \n\n\n- Injected Faults #0: ```StressChaos```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```fault-stresschaos```  \n  - Grace Period: ```0s```  \n  - Duration: ```10s```  \n- Injected Faults #1: ```PodChaos```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```fault-podchaos```  \n  - Grace Period: ```10s```  \n  - Duration: ```5s```  \n\n\n## Post-validation phase\nIn the post-validation phase, we need to ensure that the system has returned to its steady states after the fault injection. The steady states we are concerned with are the 'carts-db-replicas' and 'front-end-replica'. The post-validation phase will involve running unit tests to verify these steady states. Given the total time of 20 seconds for this phase, we will stagger the unit tests to ensure both steady states are verified within this timeframe. \n\nThe 'carts-db-replicas' steady state requires that at least 1 ready replica is available 100% of the time and 2 ready replicas are available at least 80% of the time. We will allocate 10 seconds for this test, with a grace period of 0 seconds, as we want to immediately verify the recovery of the 'carts-db' deployment after the stress test.\n\nThe 'front-end-replica' steady state requires that at least 1 ready replica is available 100% of the time. We will allocate the remaining 10 seconds for this test, also with a grace period of 0 seconds, to ensure the 'front-end' deployment has recovered from the pod kill fault.\n\nBy staggering the tests in this manner, we ensure that both steady states are verified within the 20-second post-validation phase, allowing us to confirm that the system has returned to its expected operational state.\n- Verified Steady State #0: ```carts-db-replicas```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```post-unittest-carts-db-replicas```  \n  - Grace Period: ```0s```  \n  - Duration: ```10s```  \n- Verified Steady State #1: ```front-end-replica```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```post-unittest-front-end-replica```  \n  - Grace Period: ```0s```  \n  - Duration: ```10s```  \n\n\nPlease summarize the above plan.\n\nAI: ```json\n{\"summary\":"
