    "report": "The chaos engineering experiment aimed to test the system's resilience under simulated high-demand conditions, specifically focusing on the 'carts-db' and 'front-end' components. The experiment results indicate that while the 'carts-db' component maintained its steady state throughout the experiment, the 'front-end' component failed to do so during both the fault-injection and post-validation phases. \n\n1. **Analysis of 'carts-db' Component:**\n   - The 'carts-db' deployment successfully maintained its steady state, with at least 2 ready replicas 95% of the time, as required. This indicates that the system's configuration for 'carts-db', despite lacking explicit resource requests, was able to handle the simulated resource pressure from the 'StressChaos' fault. This success suggests that the current resource allocation and scheduling policies were sufficient to meet the demands placed on 'carts-db' during the experiment.\n\n2. **Analysis of 'front-end' Component:**\n   - The 'front-end' deployment failed to maintain its steady state during the fault-injection phase, with a success rate of only 43.33%. This failure is directly linked to the 'PodChaos' fault, which killed the single replica of the 'front-end' deployment. The lack of redundancy (only one replica) meant that any disruption led to immediate downtime, as evidenced by the failure to maintain the steady state.\n   - In the post-validation phase, the 'front-end' deployment's success rate improved to 87.5%, indicating partial recovery. However, this was still below the required 100% threshold, suggesting that the system took longer than expected to recover from the fault. This delay could be due to factors such as pod scheduling delays or insufficient resources to quickly bring the 'front-end' back online.\n\n3. **Insights and Recommendations:**\n   - **Increase Redundancy:** The primary issue with the 'front-end' component is the lack of redundancy. Increasing the number of replicas for the 'front-end' deployment from 1 to at least 2 would provide the necessary redundancy to handle pod failures without causing downtime.\n   - **Resource Requests and Limits:** While the 'carts-db' component managed to maintain its steady state, it is still advisable to define resource requests and limits for all deployments, including 'carts-db', to ensure consistent performance under varying load conditions.\n   - **Improved Recovery Mechanisms:** Investigate the reasons for the delayed recovery of the 'front-end' component post-fault. This could involve optimizing pod scheduling policies or ensuring that sufficient resources are available to quickly restart failed pods.\n\nIn conclusion, the experiment highlighted the critical need for redundancy in the 'front-end' component to prevent downtime during high-demand scenarios. Addressing this issue, along with defining resource requests and improving recovery mechanisms, will enhance the system's resilience and ability to maintain steady states under fault conditions."
