                "System: You are a helpful AI assistant for Chaos Engineering.\nGiven K8s manifests for a system and user's instructions, you will define the system's steady states (i.e., normal behaviors) that are related to potential issues of the system.\nAlways keep the following rules:\n- Define steady states one by one, starting with the steady state related to the K8s resource that is easiest to encounter issues when certain failures occur.\n- Consider whether a new steady state needs to be added, and if so, add a steady state. If not, indicate the end of the steady-state addition with 'exits=True'.\n- Prioritize adding a steady state related to the issue that is easiest to occur to verify through Chaos Engineering whether it's truly a problem later.\n- An added steady state must be a measurable output, such as the number of pods, throughput, error rates, latency percentiles, etc.\n- An added steady state must be specific to a SINGLE K8s resource (i.e., manifest) having potential issues for resilency and redundancy.\n- An added steady state must be different from the already defined ones.\n- The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"thought\": {\"title\": \"Thought\", \"description\": \"Describe your thought process of determing the steady state of a SINGLE K8s resource (i.e., manifest) that is easiest to encounter the issues. Describe also the details of the steady state itself.\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"exits\": {\"title\": \"Exits\", \"description\": \"Whether to stop adding a new steady state or not. If you stop here, output 'true'. If you keep adding a new steady state, output 'false'.\", \"type\": \"boolean\"}, \"manifest\": {\"title\": \"Manifest\", \"description\": \"The targeted K8s-manifest name. Specify a SINGLE manifest.\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"name\": {\"title\": \"Name\", \"description\": \"Steady state name including the target K8s resource (manifest) name.

manifests having the issues: ['sock-shop-2/manifests/09-front-end-dep.yaml']\n  - problematic config: spec.replicas: 1\n\nIssue #2: High Initial Delay for Liveness Probe\n  - details: A high initial delay for the liveness probe can delay the detection of a failed pod, leading to longer downtime.\n  -

It is designed to demonstrate the use of microservices in a cloud-native environment, showcasing how different services interact within a Kubernetes cluster.; The manifests provided are part of a Kubernetes deployment for a microservices-based application called 'sock-shop'. This is evident from the namespace 'sock-shop' and the naming conventions used in the manifests, such as 'carts', 'catalogue', 'orders', 'payment', 'shipping', 'user', and their respective databases. These components are typical of an e-commerce application, where users can browse a catalogue, add items to a cart, place orders, and make payments. The use of images like 'weaveworksdemos/carts', 'weaveworksdemos/catalogue', and others from the 'weaveworksdemos' repository further supports this assumption, as these are known to be part of the Sock Shop demo application, which is a microservices reference architecture for an e-commerce site.\n\n# Please follow the instructions below regarding Chaos Engineering:\n- The Chaos-Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute.\n\n- When using k6 in steady-state definition, always select a request URL from the following options (other requests are invalid):\n  1. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/\n  2. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/catalogue?size=10\n  3. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/detail.html?id=<ID>\n  Replace <ID> with an available ID: [`03fef6ac-1896-4ce8-bd69-b798f85c6e0b`, `3395a43e-2d88-40de-b95f-e00e1502085b`, `510a0d7e-8e83-4193-b483-e27e09ddc34d`, `808a2de1-1aaa-4c25-a9b9-6612e8f29a38`, `819e1fbf-8b7e-4f6d-811f-693534916a8b`, `837ab141-399e-4c1f-9abc-bace40296bac`, `a0a4f044-b040-410d-8ead-4de0446aec7e`, `d3588630-ad8e-49df-bbd7-3167f7efb246`, `zzz4f044-b040-410d-8ead-4de0446aec7e`]\n  4. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/category/\n  5. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/category?tags=<TAG>\n  Replace <TAG> with an available tag: [`magic`, `action`, `blue`, `brown`, `black`, `sport`, `formal`, `red`, `green`, `skin`, `geek`]\n  6. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/basket.html\n\n# Steady states already defined are the following:\nNo steady states are defined for now.\n\nAfter considering whether a new steady state needs to be added, define a steady state that are different from the already defined steady states, if necessary.\nAI: ```json\n{\"thought\":"

If you use k6, consider not only appropriate test duration but also an appropriate number of virtual users in the load test.\n- Pay attention to namespace specification. If the namespace is specified in the manifest, it is deployed with the namespace. If not, it is deployed with the 'default' namespace.\n- When sending requests to a K8s resources, use their internal DNS names in the format: ```service-name.namespace.svc.cluster.local:port```. For the port setting, use the service port, not the targetPort or nodePort. Ensure that the port matches the service port defined in the manifest.\n- The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema.

details: Pods may not get scheduled if the cluster is under resource pressure, leading to potential downtime.\n  - manifests having the issues: ['sock-shop-2/manifests/03-carts-db-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/07-catalogue-db-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/13-orders-db-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/19-rabbitmq-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/21-session-db-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/27-user-db-dep.yaml']\n  - problematic config: The deployments for carts-db, catalogue-db, orders-db, rabbitmq, session-db, and user-db do not specify resource requests.\n\nIssue #1: Single Replica Deployment\n  - details: The front-end deployment has only one replica, which can lead to downtime if the pod fails.\n  - manifests having the issues: ['sock-shop-2/manifests/09-front-end-dep.yaml']\n  - problematic config: spec.replicas: 1\n\nIssue #2: High Initial Delay for Liveness Probe\n  - details: A high initial delay for the liveness probe can delay the detection of a failed pod, leading to longer downtime.\n  - manifests having the issues: ['sock-shop-2/manifests/05-catalogue-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/09-front-end-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/15-payment-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/25-user-dep.yaml']\n  - problematic config: livenessProbe.initialDelaySeconds: 300\n\nIssue #3: Missing Port Specification in Service\n  - details: The service may not function correctly if the port is not specified, leading to connectivity issues.\n  -

problematic config: The services for carts, carts-db, catalogue, catalogue-db, orders, orders-db, payment, queue-master, session-db, shipping, user, and user-db do not specify the port that the service should serve on.\n\nThe expected type of application on the system (i.e., K8s manfests):\nThe Sock Shop application is a microservices-based e-commerce platform that simulates an online store where users can browse a catalogue of products, add items to a shopping cart, place orders, and make payments. It is designed to demonstrate the use of microservices in a cloud-native environment, showcasing how different services interact within a Kubernetes cluster.; The manifests provided are part of a Kubernetes deployment for a microservices-based application called 'sock-shop'. This is evident from the namespace 'sock-shop' and the naming conventions used in the manifests, such as 'carts', 'catalogue', 'orders', 'payment', 'shipping', 'user', and their respective databases. These components are typical of an e-commerce application, where users can browse a catalogue, add items to a cart, place orders, and make payments. The use of images like 'weaveworksdemos/carts', 'weaveworksdemos/catalogue', and others from the 'weaveworksdemos' repository further supports this assumption, as these are known to be part of the Sock Shop demo application, which is a microservices reference architecture for an e-commerce site.\n\n# You will determine a reasonable threshold for the following steady state of my system:\ncarts-db-replicas: The first issue to address is 'Missing Resource Requests' in the 'carts-db' deployment.

It is designed to demonstrate the use of microservices in a cloud-native environment, showcasing how different services interact within a Kubernetes cluster.; The manifests provided are part of a Kubernetes deployment for a microservices-based application called 'sock-shop'. This is evident from the namespace 'sock-shop' and the naming conventions used in the manifests, such as 'carts', 'catalogue', 'orders', 'payment', 'shipping', 'user', and their respective databases. These components are typical of an e-commerce application, where users can browse a catalogue, add items to a cart, place orders, and make payments. The use of images like 'weaveworksdemos/carts', 'weaveworksdemos/catalogue', and others from the 'weaveworksdemos' repository further supports this assumption, as these are known to be part of the Sock Shop demo application, which is a microservices reference architecture for an e-commerce site.\n\n# Please follow the instructions below regarding Chaos Engineering:\n- The Chaos-Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute.\n\n- When using k6 in steady-state definition, always select a request URL from the following options (other requests are invalid):\n  1. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/\n  2. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/catalogue?size=10\n  3. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/detail.html?id=<ID>\n  Replace <ID> with an available ID: [`03fef6ac-1896-4ce8-bd69-b798f85c6e0b`, `3395a43e-2d88-40de-b95f-e00e1502085b`, `510a0d7e-8e83-4193-b483-e27e09ddc34d`, `808a2de1-1aaa-4c25-a9b9-6612e8f29a38`, `819e1fbf-8b7e-4f6d-811f-693534916a8b`, `837ab141-399e-4c1f-9abc-bace40296bac`, `a0a4f044-b040-410d-8ead-4de0446aec7e`, `d3588630-ad8e-49df-bbd7-3167f7efb246`, `zzz4f044-b040-410d-8ead-4de0446aec7e`]\n  4. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/category/\n  5. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/category?tags=<TAG>\n  Replace <TAG> with an available tag: [`magic`, `action`, `blue`, `brown`, `black`, `sport`, `formal`, `red`, `green`, `skin`, `geek`]\n  6. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/basket.html\n\n# Steady states already defined are the following:\n1 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: carts-db-replicas\n- Description: The first issue to address is 'Missing Resource Requests' in the 'carts-db' deployment. This is a critical issue because without resource requests, the pods may not get scheduled if the cluster is under resource pressure, leading to potential downtime. The 'carts-db' deployment is part of the database layer, which is crucial for the application's functionality. Ensuring that the 'carts-db' pods are running is essential for the system's steady state. Therefore, a steady state should be defined to ensure that the 'carts-db' deployment maintains its desired number of replicas, which is 2, to verify that the system can handle resource pressure without downtime.\n- Threshold for the steady state: At least 2 ready replicas for 'carts-db' must be maintained 95% of the time within a 1-minute monitoring period.; The steady state in question is the number of replicas for the 'carts-db' deployment. The current state shows that both the desired and ready replicas are consistently at 2, which is the expected number of replicas as per the deployment configuration. To ensure the system remains in a steady state, we need to define a threshold that accounts for potential fluctuations while still maintaining the necessary redundancy for reliability. Given that the system is expected to handle resource pressure without downtime, the threshold should ensure that at least 2 replicas are ready at any given time. However, to account for transient states during scaling or updates, a reasonable tolerance can be applied. Therefore, the threshold can be set such that at least 2 replicas are ready 95% of the time during the monitoring period, which is 1 minute as per the chaos engineering experiment constraints.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestCartsDBReplicas(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self, duration):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.duration = duration\n\n    def test_carts_db_replicas(self):\n        namespace = 'sock-shop'\n        deployment_name = 'carts-db'\n        v1 = client.AppsV1Api()\n\n        # Initialize counters\n        total_checks = 0\n        successful_checks = 0\n\n        # Check the deployment status for the specified duration\n        for _ in range(self.duration):\n            try:\n                deployment = v1.read_namespaced_deployment(deployment_name, namespace)\n                ready_replicas = deployment.status.ready_replicas or 0\n                print(f\"Ready replicas: {ready_replicas}\")\n\n                # Increment total checks\n                total_checks += 1\n\n                # Check if the ready replicas meet the threshold\n                if ready_replicas >= 2:\n                    successful_checks += 1\n\n            except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n                print(f\"Exception when calling AppsV1Api->read_namespaced_deployment: {e}\")\n\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the percentage of successful checks\n        success_rate = (successful_checks / total_checks) * 100\n        print(f\"Success rate: {success_rate}%\")\n\n        # Assert that the success rate meets the 95% threshold\n        assert success_rate >= 95, f\"Threshold not met: {success_rate}% < 95%\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test carts-db replicas')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=60, help='Duration to check the replicas')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    # Create an instance of the test class with the specified duration\n    test = TestCartsDBReplicas(args.duration)\n    test.test_carts_db_replicas()\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\nAfter considering whether a new steady state needs to be added, define a steady state that are different from the already defined steady states, if necessary.\nAI: ```json\n{\"thought\":"

problematic config: The services for carts, carts-db, catalogue, catalogue-db, orders, orders-db, payment, queue-master, session-db, shipping, user, and user-db do not specify the port that the service should serve on.\n\nThe expected type of application on the system (i.e., K8s manfests):\nThe Sock Shop application is a microservices-based e-commerce platform that simulates an online store where users can browse a catalogue of products, add items to a shopping cart, place orders, and make payments. It is designed to demonstrate the use of microservices in a cloud-native environment, showcasing how different services interact within a Kubernetes cluster.; The manifests provided are part of a Kubernetes deployment for a microservices-based application called 'sock-shop'. This is evident from the namespace 'sock-shop' and the naming conventions used in the manifests, such as 'carts', 'catalogue', 'orders', 'payment', 'shipping', 'user', and their respective databases. These components are typical of an e-commerce application, where users can browse a catalogue, add items to a cart, place orders, and make payments. The use of images like 'weaveworksdemos/carts', 'weaveworksdemos/catalogue', and others from the 'weaveworksdemos' repository further supports this assumption, as these are known to be part of the Sock Shop demo application, which is a microservices reference architecture for an e-commerce site.\n\n# You will determine a reasonable threshold for the following steady state of my system:\nfront-end-replicas: The next issue to address is 'Single Replica Deployment' in the 'front-end' deployment. This is a critical issue because having only one replica can lead to downtime if the pod fails. The front-end is a crucial component as it serves as the entry point for users interacting with the application.
