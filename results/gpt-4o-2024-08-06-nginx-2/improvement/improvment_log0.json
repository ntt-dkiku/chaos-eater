The pod.yaml file specifies a pod running an Nginx container, and the service.yaml file sets up a service to expose this pod on port 80. The use of the Nginx image and the exposure of port 80, which is the default HTTP port, strongly suggest that this setup is intended to serve web content. The file names and the use of Nginx, a popular web server, further support this assumption.\n\n# Here is the hypothesis for my system:\nThe hypothesis is \"The steady states of the sytem are maintained even when the fault scenario occurs (i.e., when the faults are injected)\".\nThe steady states here are as follows:\n2 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: example-pod-running\n- Description: The first issue to address is the Pod's restart policy set to 'Never', which means the Pod will not restart automatically if it fails. This is a critical issue because it can lead to downtime if the Pod encounters any failure. Therefore, the steady state should verify that the Pod is running and has not failed. This can be measured by checking the Pod's status to ensure it is in the 'Running' state. This steady state is specific to the 'nginx/pod.yaml' manifest, which defines the Pod with the problematic restart policy.\n- Threshold for the steady state: The Pod should be in the 'Running' state at least 90% of the time during the observation period.; The steady state we are considering is that the Pod should be in the 'Running' state. The current state shows that the Pod was running 5 out of 5 seconds, which indicates a 100% uptime during the observation period. Given that the Chaos Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute, we can set a threshold that allows for some minor fluctuations but still ensures high availability. A reasonable threshold would be that the Pod should be in the 'Running' state at least 90% of the time during the observation period. This allows for brief interruptions or delays in status updates while still maintaining a high level of reliability.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestPodRunningState(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self, namespace, pod_name, duration):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.namespace = namespace\n        self.pod_name = pod_name\n        self.duration = duration\n\n    def test_pod_running_state(self):\n        running_count = 0\n        # Check the pod status every second for the specified duration\n        for _ in range(self.duration):\n            try:\n                pod = self.v1.read_namespaced_pod(name=self.pod_name, namespace=self.namespace)\n                if pod.status.phase == 'Running':\n                    running_count += 1\n                print(f\"Pod status: {pod.status.phase}\")\n            except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n                print(f\"Exception when calling CoreV1Api->read_namespaced_pod: {e}\")\n            time.sleep(1)\n        # Calculate the running percentage\n        running_percentage = (running_count / self.duration) * 100\n        print(f\"Pod was running {running_count} out of {self.duration} seconds.\")\n        print(f\"Running percentage: {running_percentage}%\")\n        # Assert that the running percentage meets the threshold\n        assert running_percentage >= 90, f\"Pod running percentage {running_percentage}% is below the threshold of 90%.\"\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test the running state of a Kubernetes Pod.')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=5, help='Duration to check the pod status in seconds')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n    # Create an instance of the test class\n    test = TestPodRunningState(namespace='default', pod_name='example-pod', duration=args.duration)\n    # Run the test\n    test.test_pod_running_state()\n\n```2nd steady states:\n- Name: example-service-availability\n- Description: The next issue to address is the lack of redundancy due to the use of a single Pod without a controller like Deployment or ReplicaSet. This can lead to a lack of automatic recovery if the Pod fails. To verify the system's resilience, we should define a steady state that measures the availability of the service provided by the Pod. Since the Service 'example-service' is responsible for exposing the Pod, we can measure the service's availability by checking the response time or success rate of HTTP requests to the service. This steady state is specific to the 'nginx/service.yaml' manifest, which defines the Service that forwards traffic to the Pod.\n- Threshold for the steady state: HTTP request success rate >= 99%; The steady state we are considering is the availability of the 'example-service', which is measured by the success rate of HTTP requests. The k6 test results show that 100% of the requests returned a status of 200, indicating that the service is fully available. To define a reasonable threshold, we should consider a success rate that accounts for minor fluctuations or transient issues that might occur in a real-world scenario. A success rate of 99% is a common threshold for availability, allowing for some tolerance while still ensuring high availability. This threshold is also satisfied by the current state, which shows a 100% success rate.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following K6 Javascript:\n```\nimport http from 'k6/http';\nimport { check } from 'k6';\n\nexport const options = {\n  vus: 1,\n  duration: '5s',\n  thresholds: {\n    // Define a threshold for the success rate of HTTP requests\n    'http_req_failed': ['rate<=0.01'], // This ensures that the failure rate is 1% or less, meaning the success rate is 99% or more\n  },\n};\n\nexport default function () {\n  const res = http.get('http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:80');\n  check(res, {\n    'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,\n  });\n}\n\n```\n\nThe fault scenario here is as follows:\n\nAn assumed fault scenario is as follows:\n- Event: Cyber Attack Simulation\n- Used Chaos Engineering tool: Chaos Mesh\n- Faults to simulate the event: [[Fault(name='PodChaos', name_id=0, params={'action': 'pod-kill', 'mode': 'one', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}})], [Fault(name='NetworkChaos', name_id=1, params={'action': 'delay', 'direction': 'to', 'mode': 'all', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}, 'delay': {'latency': '100ms', 'jitter': '10ms'}})]]\n- Description: Given the system's weaknesses, a cyber attack simulation can be impactful. The system has a single Pod with a 'Never' restart policy, making it vulnerable to downtime if the Pod fails. Additionally, the lack of redundancy means that any failure in the Pod will directly affect the service availability. To simulate a cyber attack, we can start by injecting a 'PodChaos' fault to kill the Pod, testing the system's ability to maintain the 'example-pod-running' steady state. This will reveal the impact of the Pod's restart policy and lack of redundancy. Next, we can inject a 'NetworkChaos' fault to introduce network latency, simulating a DDoS attack, and testing the 'example-service-availability' steady state. This will reveal how the system handles network disruptions and whether the service can maintain a high success rate under stress. The sequence of injecting Pod failure first, followed by network latency, simulates a scenario where an attacker first disrupts the Pod and then targets the network, maximizing the impact on the system.\n\n# Here is the overview of my Chaos-Engineering experiment to verify the hypothesis:\nThe Chaos Engineering experiment is structured into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation, all within a 1-minute timeframe. \n\nIn the pre-validation phase, which lasts for 15 seconds, two unit tests are executed simultaneously to verify the system's steady state. The 'example-pod-running' test, with the workflow name 'pre-unittest-example-pod-running', and the 'example-service-availability' test, with the workflow name 'pre-unittest-example-service-availability', both start immediately at the beginning of this phase and run for the entire 15 seconds. These tests ensure that the Pod is running and the service is available before proceeding to fault injection.\n\nThe fault-injection phase spans 30 seconds and involves staggered execution of faults and unit tests. Initially, the 'PodChaos' fault, with the workflow name 'fault-podchaos', is injected at the start of this phase and lasts for 10 seconds. Concurrently, at 10 seconds into the phase, the 'example-pod-running' unit test, with the workflow name 'fault-unittest-example-pod-running', is conducted for 5 seconds to assess the Pod's resilience. Following this, at 15 seconds, the 'NetworkChaos' fault, with the workflow name 'fault-networkchaos', is introduced for 10 seconds. Subsequently, at 25 seconds, the 'example-service-availability' unit test, with the workflow name 'fault-unittest-example-service-availability', is executed for 5 seconds to evaluate the service's performance under network stress.\n\nIn the post-validation phase, which also lasts 15 seconds, unit tests are performed sequentially to confirm the system's return to steady states. The 'example-pod-running' test, with the workflow name 'post-unittest-example-pod-running', starts immediately and runs for 7 seconds. Following this, the 'example-service-availability' test, with the workflow name 'post-unittest-example-service-availability', begins at 7 seconds and continues for the remaining 8 seconds. This phase ensures that both the Pod and service have stabilized after the fault injections.\n\n# The experiment's results of the original system are as follows:\nPassed unittests:\n- pre-unittest-example-pod-running\n- pre-unittest-example-service-availability\nFailed unittests:\n- fault-unittest-example-pod-running\n```log\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/chaos-eater/sandbox/cycle_20241124_124358/hypothesis/unittest_example-pod-running_mod0.py\", line 40, in <module>\nException when calling CoreV1Api->read_namespaced_pod: (404)\nReason: Not Found\n    test.test_pod_running_state()\n  File \"/chaos-eater/sandbox/cycle_20241124_124358/hypothesis/unittest_example-pod-running_mod0.py\", line 31, in test_pod_running_state\n    assert running_percentage >= 90, f\"Pod running percentage {running_percentage}% is below...json', 'X-Kubernetes-Pf-Flowschema-Uid': 'c4624bd9-7fc7-42c6-bcb8-4235110a860d', 'X-Kubernetes-Pf-Prioritylevel-Uid': '4706085f-6263-43ae-93f5-b4a61de8b6be', 'Date': 'Sun, 24 Nov 2024 12:50:58 GMT', 'Content-Length': '190'})\nHTTP response body: {\"kind\":\"Status\",\"apiVersion\":\"v1\",\"metadata\":{},\"status\":\"Failure\",\"message\":\"pods \\\"example-pod\\\" not found\",\"reason\":\"NotFound\",\"details\":{\"name\":\"example-pod\",\"kind\":\"pods\"},\"code\":404}\n\n\nPod was running 0 out of 5 seconds.\nRunning percentage: 0.0%\n\n```\n\n- fault-unittest-example-service-availability\n```log\ntime=\"2024-11-24T12:51:10Z\" level=warning msg=\"Request Failed\" error=\"Get \\\"http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:80\\\": dial tcp 10.96.216.95:80: connect: connection refused\"\ntime=\"2024-11-24T12:51:10Z\" level=warning msg=\"Request Failed\" error=\"Get \\\"http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:80\\\": dial tcp 10.96.216.95:80: connect: connection refused\"\ntime=\"2024-11-24T12:51:10Z\" level=warning msg=\"Request Failed\" error=\"Get \\\"http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:8...  min=0s       med=0s     max=0s    p(90)=0s    p(95)=0s   \n     http_reqs..................: 11      2.149218/s\n     iteration_duration.........: avg=465.24ms min=278.11\u00b5s med=3.48ms max=1.02s p(90)=1.02s p(95)=1.02s\n     iterations.................: 11      2.149218/s\n     vus........................: 1       min=1        max=1\n     vus_max....................: 1       min=1        max=1\n\ntime=\"2024-11-24T12:51:16Z\" level=error msg=\"thresholds on metrics 'http_req_failed' have been crossed\"\n\n```\n\n- post-unittest-example-pod-running\n```log\nException when calling CoreV1Api->read_namespaced_pod: (404)\nReason: Not Found\nHTTP response headers: HTTPHeaderDict({'Audit-Id': '11837e86-cb85-4e62-9340-c47012af9dc8', 'Cache-Control': 'no-cache, private', 'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'X-Kubernetes-Pf-Flowschema-Uid': 'c4624bd9-7fc7-42c6-bcb8-4235110a860d', 'X-Kubernetes-Pf-Prioritylevel-Uid': '4706085f-6263-43ae-93f5-b4a61de8b6be', 'Date': 'Sun, 24 Nov 2024 12:51:21 GMT', 'Content-Length': '190'})\nHTTP response body: {\"kind\":\"Status\"...nt call last):\n  File \"/chaos-eater/sandbox/cycle_20241124_124358/hypothesis/unittest_example-pod-running_mod0.py\", line 40, in <module>\n    test.test_pod_running_state()\n  File \"/chaos-eater/sandbox/cycle_20241124_124358/hypothesis/unittest_example-pod-running_mod0.py\", line 31, in test_pod_running_state\n    assert running_percentage >= 90, f\"Pod running percentage {running_percentage}% is below the threshold of 90%.\"\nAssertionError: Pod running percentage 0.0% is below the threshold of 90%.\n\n```\n\n- post-unittest-example-service-availability\n```log\ntime=\"2024-11-24T12:51:29Z\" level=warning msg=\"Request Failed\" error=\"Get \\\"http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:80\\\": dial tcp 10.96.216.95:80: connect: connection refused\"\ntime=\"2024-11-24T12:51:29Z\" level=warning msg=\"Request Failed\" error=\"Get \\\"http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:80\\\": dial tcp 10.96.216.95:80: connect: connection refused\"\ntime=\"2024-11-24T12:51:29Z\" level=warning msg=\"Request Failed\" error=\"Get \\\"http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:8...=0s    min=0s       med=0s    max=0s    p(90)=0s    p(95)=0s   \n     http_reqs..................: 14      1.706363/s\n     iteration_duration.........: avg=586ms min=174.94\u00b5s med=1.02s max=1.03s p(90)=1.02s p(95)=1.02s\n     iterations.................: 14      1.706363/s\n     vus........................: 1       min=1        max=1\n     vus_max....................: 1       min=1        max=1\n\ntime=\"2024-11-24T12:51:37Z\" level=error msg=\"thresholds on metrics 'http_req_failed' have been crossed\"\n\n```\n\n\nFirst, please analyze the results and provide an analysis report rich in insights.\nAI: # Here is my analysis report:\nThe Chaos Engineering experiment results indicate a failure in maintaining the steady states during and after the fault injection phase. Let's analyze the reasons for these failures step by step:\n\n1. **Pre-Validation Phase Success**: Both pre-unittest-example-pod-running and pre-unittest-example-service-availability tests passed, confirming that the system was in a steady state before the fault injection. The Pod was running, and the service was available, as expected.\n\n2. **Fault-Unit Test Failures**:\n   - **fault-unittest-example-pod-running**: This test failed because the Pod was not found during the fault injection phase. The 'PodChaos' fault, which involved killing the Pod, was injected at the start of the fault-injection phase. Since the Pod's restart policy is set to 'Never', it did not restart after being killed, leading to a 0% running time during the test. This directly correlates with the identified issue #0 (Pod Restart Policy) and issue #1 (Single Pod Deployment) in the system configuration.\n   - **fault-unittest-example-service-availability**: This test also failed due to the service being unavailable. The 'PodChaos' fault resulted in the Pod being killed, and since there was no redundancy (issue #1), the service had no backend Pod to route traffic to, leading to connection refusals. The subsequent 'NetworkChaos' fault, which introduced network latency, further compounded the issue by simulating a network disruption, but the primary cause of failure was the absence of a running Pod.\n\n3. **Post-Validation Phase Failures**:\n   - **post-unittest-example-pod-running**: The Pod was still not found, as indicated by the 404 error. This is expected because the Pod was not configured to restart automatically after being killed, and no manual intervention or controller (like a Deployment) was in place to recreate it.\n   - **post-unittest-example-service-availability**: The service remained unavailable, as the Pod was not running, leading to continued connection refusals. This highlights the critical impact of having a single Pod without redundancy or a restart mechanism.\n\n**Insights and Recommendations**:\n- **Pod Restart Policy**: Change the Pod's restart policy from 'Never' to 'Always' or 'OnFailure' to ensure it restarts automatically after a failure.\n- **Redundancy and Scalability**: Use a Deployment or ReplicaSet instead of a single Pod to manage the Nginx container. This will provide redundancy and ensure that if one Pod fails, others can take over, maintaining service availability.\n- **Service Resilience**: Ensure that the Service is backed by multiple Pods to handle failures and maintain availability. This can be achieved by scaling the Deployment to have multiple replicas.\n- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Implement monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect and respond to Pod failures promptly, ensuring minimal downtime.\n\nBy addressing these issues, the system can improve its resilience and maintain steady states even during fault scenarios.\nHuman: Then, please reconfigure the system to avoid the fails (improve resiliency).\nAI: ```json\n{\"thought\":"
