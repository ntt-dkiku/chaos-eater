    "report": "The Chaos Engineering experiment results indicate a failure in maintaining the steady states during and after the fault injection phase. Let's analyze the reasons for these failures step by step:\n\n1. **Pre-Validation Phase Success**: Both pre-unittest-example-pod-running and pre-unittest-example-service-availability tests passed, confirming that the system was in a steady state before the fault injection. The Pod was running, and the service was available, as expected.\n\n2. **Fault-Unit Test Failures**:\n   - **fault-unittest-example-pod-running**: This test failed because the Pod was not found during the fault injection phase. The 'PodChaos' fault, which involved killing the Pod, was injected at the start of the fault-injection phase. Since the Pod's restart policy is set to 'Never', it did not restart after being killed, leading to a 0% running time during the test. This directly correlates with the identified issue #0 (Pod Restart Policy) and issue #1 (Single Pod Deployment) in the system configuration.\n   - **fault-unittest-example-service-availability**: This test also failed due to the service being unavailable. The 'PodChaos' fault resulted in the Pod being killed, and since there was no redundancy (issue #1), the service had no backend Pod to route traffic to, leading to connection refusals. The subsequent 'NetworkChaos' fault, which introduced network latency, further compounded the issue by simulating a network disruption, but the primary cause of failure was the absence of a running Pod.\n\n3. **Post-Validation Phase Failures**:\n   - **post-unittest-example-pod-running**: The Pod was still not found, as indicated by the 404 error. This is expected because the Pod was not configured to restart automatically after being killed, and no manual intervention or controller (like a Deployment) was in place to recreate it.\n   - **post-unittest-example-service-availability**: The service remained unavailable, as the Pod was not running, leading to continued connection refusals. This highlights the critical impact of having a single Pod without redundancy or a restart mechanism.\n\n**Insights and Recommendations**:\n- **Pod Restart Policy**: Change the Pod's restart policy from 'Never' to 'Always' or 'OnFailure' to ensure it restarts automatically after a failure.\n- **Redundancy and Scalability**: Use a Deployment or ReplicaSet instead of a single Pod to manage the Nginx container. This will provide redundancy and ensure that if one Pod fails, others can take over, maintaining service availability.\n- **Service Resilience**: Ensure that the Service is backed by multiple Pods to handle failures and maintain availability. This can be achieved by scaling the Deployment to have multiple replicas.\n- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Implement monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect and respond to Pod failures promptly, ensuring minimal downtime.\n\nBy addressing these issues, the system can improve its resilience and maintain steady states even during fault scenarios."
