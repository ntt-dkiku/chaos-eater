User-input understanding\n### Here is the overview of user inputs:\nThe system consists of the following K8s manifest(s):K8s manifest: nginx/pod.yaml\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: example-pod\n  labels:\n    app: example\nspec:\n  restartPolicy: Never\n  containers:\n  - name: example-container\n    image: nginx:1.17.1\n    ports:\n    - containerPort: 80\n```\nSummary of nginx/pod.yaml:\n- This manifest defines a Kubernetes Pod.\n- The Pod is named 'example-pod'.\n- It includes metadata with a label 'app: example'.\n- The Pod's restart policy is set to 'Never', meaning it won't restart automatically if it fails.\n- The Pod contains one container named 'example-container'.\n- The container uses the 'nginx:1.17.1' image.\n- The container exposes port 80 for network traffic.\n\nK8s manifest: nginx/service.yaml\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: example-service\nspec:\n  selector:\n    app: example\n  ports:\n    - protocol: TCP\n      port: 80\n      targetPort: 80\n```\nSummary of nginx/service.yaml:\n- This manifest defines a Kubernetes Service.\n- The Service is named 'example-service'.\n- It uses the 'v1' API version.\n- The Service selects pods with the label 'app: example'.\n- It exposes the Service on port 80 using the TCP protocol.\n- The Service forwards traffic to the target port 80 on the selected pods.\n\nThe resiliency issues/weaknesses in the system are as follows:\nIssue #0: Pod Restart Policy\n  - details: The Pod will not restart automatically if it fails, which can lead to downtime.\n  - manifests having the issues: ['nginx/pod.yaml']\n  - problematic config: restartPolicy: Never\n\nIssue #1: Single Pod Deployment\n  - details: Using a single Pod without a controller like Deployment or ReplicaSet can lead to lack of redundancy and no automatic recovery if the Pod fails.\n  - manifests having the issues: ['nginx/pod.yaml']\n  - problematic config: kind: Pod\n\nThe expected type of application on the system (i.e., K8s manfests):\nWeb server hosting static or dynamic web content using Nginx.; The manifests provided are for a basic setup of an Nginx web server. The pod.yaml file specifies a pod running an Nginx container, and the service.yaml file sets up a service to expose this pod on port 80. The use of the Nginx image and the exposure of port 80, which is the default HTTP port, strongly suggest that this setup is intended to serve web content. The file names and the use of Nginx, a popular web server, further support this assumption.\n\nChaos-Engineering instructions for the system are as follows: - The Chaos-Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute.\n\n## Step 1. Hypothesis definition\n### Here is the overview of the hypothesis for the system:\nThe hypothesis is \"The steady states of the sytem are maintained even when the fault scenario occurs (i.e., when the faults are injected)\".\nThe steady states here are as follows:\n2 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: example-pod-running\n- Description: The first issue to address is the Pod's restart policy set to 'Never', which means the Pod will not restart automatically if it fails. This is a critical issue because it can lead to downtime if the Pod encounters any failure. Therefore, the steady state should verify that the Pod is running and has not failed. This can be measured by checking the Pod's status to ensure it is in the 'Running' state. This steady state is specific to the 'nginx/pod.yaml' manifest, which defines the Pod with the problematic restart policy.\n- Threshold for the steady state: The Pod should be in the 'Running' state at least 90% of the time during the observation period.; The steady state we are considering is that the Pod should be in the 'Running' state. The current state shows that the Pod was running 5 out of 5 seconds, which indicates a 100% uptime during the observation period. Given that the Chaos Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute, we can set a threshold that allows for some minor fluctuations but still ensures high availability. A reasonable threshold would be that the Pod should be in the 'Running' state at least 90% of the time during the observation period. This allows for brief interruptions or delays in status updates while still maintaining a high level of reliability.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestPodRunningState(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self, namespace, pod_name, duration):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.namespace = namespace\n        self.pod_name = pod_name\n        self.duration = duration\n\n    def test_pod_running_state(self):\n        running_count = 0\n        # Check the pod status every second for the specified duration\n        for _ in range(self.duration):\n            try:\n                pod = self.v1.read_namespaced_pod(name=self.pod_name, namespace=self.namespace)\n                if pod.status.phase == 'Running':\n                    running_count += 1\n                print(f\"Pod status: {pod.status.phase}\")\n            except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n                print(f\"Exception when calling CoreV1Api->read_namespaced_pod: {e}\")\n            time.sleep(1)\n        # Calculate the running percentage\n        running_percentage = (running_count / self.duration) * 100\n        print(f\"Pod was running {running_count} out of {self.duration} seconds.\")\n        print(f\"Running percentage: {running_percentage}%\")\n        # Assert that the running percentage meets the threshold\n        assert running_percentage >= 90, f\"Pod running percentage {running_percentage}% is below the threshold of 90%.\"\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test the running state of a Kubernetes Pod.')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=5, help='Duration to check the pod status in seconds')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n    # Create an instance of the test class\n    test = TestPodRunningState(namespace='default', pod_name='example-pod', duration=args.duration)\n    # Run the test\n    test.test_pod_running_state()\n\n```2nd steady states:\n- Name: example-service-availability\n- Description: The next issue to address is the lack of redundancy due to the use of a single Pod without a controller like Deployment or ReplicaSet. This can lead to a lack of automatic recovery if the Pod fails. To verify the system's resilience, we should define a steady state that measures the availability of the service provided by the Pod. Since the Service 'example-service' is responsible for exposing the Pod, we can measure the service's availability by checking the response time or success rate of HTTP requests to the service. This steady state is specific to the 'nginx/service.yaml' manifest, which defines the Service that forwards traffic to the Pod.\n- Threshold for the steady state: HTTP request success rate >= 99%; The steady state we are considering is the availability of the 'example-service', which is measured by the success rate of HTTP requests. The k6 test results show that 100% of the requests returned a status of 200, indicating that the service is fully available. To define a reasonable threshold, we should consider a success rate that accounts for minor fluctuations or transient issues that might occur in a real-world scenario. A success rate of 99% is a common threshold for availability, allowing for some tolerance while still ensuring high availability. This threshold is also satisfied by the current state, which shows a 100% success rate.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following K6 Javascript:\n```\nimport http from 'k6/http';\nimport { check } from 'k6';\n\nexport const options = {\n  vus: 1,\n  duration: '5s',\n  thresholds: {\n    // Define a threshold for the success rate of HTTP requests\n    'http_req_failed': ['rate<=0.01'], // This ensures that the failure rate is 1% or less, meaning the success rate is 99% or more\n  },\n};\n\nexport default function () {\n  const res = http.get('http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:80');\n  check(res, {\n    'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,\n  });\n}\n\n```\n\nThe fault scenario here is as follows:\n\nAn assumed fault scenario is as follows:\n- Event: Cyber Attack Simulation\n- Used Chaos Engineering tool: Chaos Mesh\n- Faults to simulate the event: [[Fault(name='PodChaos', name_id=0, params={'action': 'pod-kill', 'mode': 'one', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}})], [Fault(name='NetworkChaos', name_id=1, params={'action': 'delay', 'direction': 'to', 'mode': 'all', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}, 'delay': {'latency': '100ms', 'jitter': '10ms'}})]]\n- Description: Given the system's weaknesses, a cyber attack simulation can be impactful. The system has a single Pod with a 'Never' restart policy, making it vulnerable to downtime if the Pod fails. Additionally, the lack of redundancy means that any failure in the Pod will directly affect the service availability. To simulate a cyber attack, we can start by injecting a 'PodChaos' fault to kill the Pod, testing the system's ability to maintain the 'example-pod-running' steady state. This will reveal the impact of the Pod's restart policy and lack of redundancy. Next, we can inject a 'NetworkChaos' fault to introduce network latency, simulating a DDoS attack, and testing the 'example-service-availability' steady state. This will reveal how the system handles network disruptions and whether the service can maintain a high success rate under stress. The sequence of injecting Pod failure first, followed by network latency, simulates a scenario where an attacker first disrupts the Pod and then targets the network, maximizing the impact on the system.\n\n## Step 2.1. Chaos-Engineering experiment\n### Here is the overview of my Chaos-Engineering experiment to verify the hypothesis:\nThe entire time schedule of the Chaos-Engineering experiment is as follows (The experiment is divided into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation phases):\nGiven the constraints and the nature of the system, we need to design a Chaos Engineering experiment that fits within a 1-minute timeframe. The experiment will be divided into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation. The pre-validation phase will ensure that the system is in a steady state before any faults are injected. This involves checking that the Pod is running and the service is available. The fault-injection phase will simulate a cyber attack by first killing the Pod and then introducing network latency. This will test the system's resilience to these faults. Finally, the post-validation phase will verify that the system returns to its steady states after the faults are removed. Given the 1-minute constraint, a reasonable time allocation would be 15 seconds for pre-validation, 30 seconds for fault injection, and 15 seconds for post-validation. This allows enough time to observe the system's behavior during each phase while staying within the overall time limit.\n- Total experiment phase: 1m\n- Pre-validation phase: 15s\n- Fault-injection phase: 30s\n- Post-validation phase: 15s\n\nThe details of the three phases are as follows:\nPre-validation Phase (15s):\nIn the pre-validation phase, we need to ensure that the system is in its expected steady states before we proceed with fault injection. Given the constraints, we have 15 seconds to perform these checks. We have two steady states to verify: 'example-pod-running' and 'example-service-availability'. To efficiently utilize the time, we will run both unit tests simultaneously. This approach allows us to maximize the use of the available time and ensure that both steady states are verified within the 15-second window. The 'example-pod-running' test will check if the Pod is in the 'Running' state for at least 90% of the time, while the 'example-service-availability' test will verify that the HTTP request success rate is at least 99%. By running these tests concurrently, we can quickly confirm that the system is stable and ready for the fault injection phase.\n\nFault-injection Phase (30s):\nIn this fault-injection phase, we aim to simulate a cyber attack scenario by injecting two types of faults: 'PodChaos' and 'NetworkChaos'. The goal is to observe the system's behavior under these conditions and assess its resilience. Given the 30-second time constraint for this phase, we need to carefully schedule the fault injections and unit tests to maximize the insights gained while ensuring the experiment remains within the allotted time.\n\nThe approach is to stagger the fault injections and unit tests to observe the system's response to each fault type separately. We will start with the 'PodChaos' fault, which will kill the Pod, and then follow with the 'NetworkChaos' fault, which introduces network latency. This sequence simulates an attack where the Pod is disrupted first, followed by network interference.\n\nThe 'PodChaos' fault will be injected at the beginning of the phase, with a short duration to allow time for the system to react. Immediately after the 'PodChaos' fault, we will run the unit test for the 'example-pod-running' steady state to verify if the Pod remains in the 'Running' state despite the fault. This test will help us understand the impact of the Pod's restart policy and lack of redundancy.\n\nNext, we will inject the 'NetworkChaos' fault, which introduces network latency. After this fault is injected, we will run the unit test for the 'example-service-availability' steady state to check if the service can maintain a high success rate under network stress. This test will reveal how the system handles network disruptions.\n\nBy staggering the fault injections and unit tests, we can isolate the effects of each fault and gain a clearer understanding of the system's resilience. The timing is designed to ensure that each fault and test fits within the 30-second phase, allowing us to complete the experiment efficiently.\n\nPost-validation Phase (15s):\nIn the post-validation phase, we need to ensure that the system has returned to its steady states after the fault injection. Given the 15-second time constraint, we will conduct unit tests to verify each steady state. The tests will be executed sequentially due to the short duration, allowing us to focus on one steady state at a time and ensure accurate validation. The first test will check the 'example-pod-running' steady state, ensuring the Pod is back in the 'Running' state. The second test will verify the 'example-service-availability' steady state, ensuring the service is available with a high success rate. Each test will have a brief grace period to allow the system to stabilize after the fault injection, followed by a short duration to perform the validation.\n\nThe summary of the above experiment plan:\nThe Chaos Engineering experiment is structured into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation, all within a 1-minute timeframe. \n\nIn the pre-validation phase, which lasts for 15 seconds, two unit tests are executed simultaneously to verify the system's steady state. The 'example-pod-running' test, with the workflow name 'pre-unittest-example-pod-running', and the 'example-service-availability' test, with the workflow name 'pre-unittest-example-service-availability', both start immediately at the beginning of this phase and run for the entire 15 seconds. These tests ensure that the Pod is running and the service is available before proceeding to fault injection.\n\nThe fault-injection phase spans 30 seconds and involves staggered execution of faults and unit tests. Initially, the 'PodChaos' fault, with the workflow name 'fault-podchaos', is injected at the start of this phase and lasts for 10 seconds. Concurrently, at 10 seconds into the phase, the 'example-pod-running' unit test, with the workflow name 'fault-unittest-example-pod-running', is conducted for 5 seconds to assess the Pod's resilience. Following this, at 15 seconds, the 'NetworkChaos' fault, with the workflow name 'fault-networkchaos', is introduced for 10 seconds. Subsequently, at 25 seconds, the 'example-service-availability' unit test, with the workflow name 'fault-unittest-example-service-availability', is executed for 5 seconds to evaluate the service's performance under network stress.\n\nIn the post-validation phase, which also lasts 15 seconds, unit tests are performed sequentially to confirm the system's return to steady states. The 'example-pod-running' test, with the workflow name 'post-unittest-example-pod-running', starts immediately and runs for 7 seconds. Following this, the 'example-service-availability' test, with the workflow name 'post-unittest-example-service-availability', begins at 7 seconds and continues for the remaining 8 seconds. This phase ensures that both the Pod and service have stabilized after the fault injections.\n\nTo automatically conduct the above experiment plan with Chaos Mesh, the following Chaos-Mesh-Worfklow file was created (by applying it to the cluster, the experiment plan will be automatically executed according to the Chaos-Mesh-Worfklow file):\n```yaml\napiVersion: chaos-mesh.org/v1alpha1\nkind: Workflow\nmetadata:\n  name: chaos-experiment-20241124-125548\nspec:\n  entry: the-entry\n  templates:\n    #-------------------------------\n    # entry point of whole workflow\n    #-------------------------------\n    -

Let's analyze the reasons for these failures step by step:\n\n1. **Pre-Validation Phase Success**: Both pre-unittest-example-pod-running and pre-unittest-example-service-availability tests passed, confirming that the system was in a steady state before the fault injection. The Pod was running, and the service was available, as expected.\n\n2. **Fault-Unit Test Failures**:\n   - **fault-unittest-example-pod-running**: This test failed because the Pod was not found during the fault injection phase. The 'PodChaos' fault, which involved killing the Pod, was injected at the start of the fault-injection phase. Since the Pod's restart policy is set to 'Never', it did not restart after being killed, leading to a 0% running time during the test. This directly correlates with the identified issue #0 (Pod Restart Policy) and issue #1 (Single Pod Deployment) in the system configuration.\n   - **fault-unittest-example-service-availability**: This test also failed due to the service being unavailable. The 'PodChaos' fault resulted in the Pod being killed, and since there was no redundancy (issue #1), the service had no backend Pod to route traffic to, leading to connection refusals. The subsequent 'NetworkChaos' fault, which introduced network latency, further compounded the issue by simulating a network disruption, but the primary cause of failure was the absence of a running Pod.\n\n3. **Post-Validation Phase Failures**:\n   - **post-unittest-example-pod-running**: The Pod was still not found, as indicated by the 404 error. This is expected because the Pod was not configured to restart automatically after being killed, and no manual intervention or controller (like a Deployment) was in place to recreate it.\n   - **post-unittest-example-service-availability**: The service remained unavailable, as the Pod was not running, leading to continued connection refusals. This highlights the critical impact of having a single Pod without redundancy or a restart mechanism.\n\n**Insights and Recommendations**:\n- **Pod Restart Policy**: Change the Pod's restart policy from 'Never' to 'Always' or 'OnFailure' to ensure it restarts automatically after a failure.\n- **Redundancy and Scalability**: Use a Deployment or ReplicaSet instead of a single Pod to manage the Nginx container. This will provide redundancy and ensure that if one Pod fails, others can take over, maintaining service availability.\n- **Service Resilience**: Ensure that the Service is backed by multiple Pods to handle failures and maintain availability. This can be achieved by scaling the Deployment to have multiple replicas.\n- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Implement monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect and respond to Pod failures promptly, ensuring minimal downtime.\n\nBy addressing these issues, the system can improve its resilience and maintain steady states even during fault scenarios.\n\n### Improvement result (1st try)\n1 K8s manifests are modified:\n- The K8s manifest 'nginx/pod.yaml' was replaced.\nReplace the Pod manifest with a Deployment manifest to provide redundancy and automatic recovery. The Deployment will manage multiple replicas of the Pod, ensuring that the service remains available even if one Pod fails.\n```yaml\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: example-deployment\n  labels:\n    app: example\nspec:\n  replicas: 3\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: example\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: example\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: example-container\n        image: nginx:1.17.1\n        ports:\n        - containerPort: 80\n\n```\n\n\n\n### Experiment result (2nd try)\nPassed unittests:\n- pre-unittest-example-pod-running\n- pre-unittest-example-service-availability\n- fault-unittest-example-pod-running\n- fault-unittest-example-service-availability\n- post-unittest-example-pod-running\n- post-unittest-example-service-availability\nFailed unittests:\n\n\nPlease elaborate the above summary of a Chaos Engineering Cycle.\nAI: ```json\n{\"summary\":"
            ],
            "{\"summary\":\"The Chaos Engineering cycle involves a structured approach to testing the resilience of a Kubernetes-based system, specifically focusing on an Nginx web server setup. The cycle begins with understanding the user inputs, which include Kubernetes manifests for a Pod and a Service. The Pod manifest defines a single Nginx container with a 'Never' restart policy, while the Service manifest exposes this Pod on port 80. Identified weaknesses include the Pod's restart policy and the lack of redundancy due to a single Pod deployment.\\n\\nThe hypothesis for the experiment is that the system should maintain its steady states even when faults are injected. Two steady states are defined: the Pod should be running at least 90% of the time, and the Service should have an HTTP request success rate of at least 99%. These are tested using Python scripts and K6 JavaScript, respectively.\\n\\nThe fault scenario simulates a cyber attack using Chaos Mesh, injecting 'PodChaos' to kill the Pod and 'NetworkChaos' to introduce network latency. The experiment is divided into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation, all within a 1-minute timeframe. Pre-validation ensures the system is stable, fault-injection tests resilience under attack, and post-validation checks recovery.\\n\\nInitially, the experiment fails due to the Pod not restarting after being killed and the Service becoming unavailable. Analysis reveals the need for a Deployment to manage multiple Pod replicas, providing redundancy and automatic recovery. After modifying the Pod manifest to a Deployment with three replicas, the experiment is rerun successfully, with all unit tests passing, confirming the system's improved resilience.\"}"
