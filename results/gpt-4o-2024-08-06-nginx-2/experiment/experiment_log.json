The pod.yaml file specifies a pod running an Nginx container, and the service.yaml file sets up a service to expose this pod on port 80. The use of the Nginx image and the exposure of port 80, which is the default HTTP port, strongly suggest that this setup is intended to serve web content. The file names and the use of Nginx, a popular web server, further support this assumption.\n\n# Steady states of my system:\n2 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: example-pod-running\n- Description: The first issue to address is the Pod's restart policy set to 'Never', which means the Pod will not restart automatically if it fails. This is a critical issue because it can lead to downtime if the Pod encounters any failure. Therefore, the steady state should verify that the Pod is running and has not failed. This can be measured by checking the Pod's status to ensure it is in the 'Running' state. This steady state is specific to the 'nginx/pod.yaml' manifest, which defines the Pod with the problematic restart policy.\n- Threshold for the steady state: The Pod should be in the 'Running' state at least 90% of the time during the observation period.; The steady state we are considering is that the Pod should be in the 'Running' state. The current state shows that the Pod was running 5 out of 5 seconds, which indicates a 100% uptime during the observation period. Given that the Chaos Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute, we can set a threshold that allows for some minor fluctuations but still ensures high availability. A reasonable threshold would be that the Pod should be in the 'Running' state at least 90% of the time during the observation period. This allows for brief interruptions or delays in status updates while still maintaining a high level of reliability.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestPodRunningState(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self, namespace, pod_name, duration):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.namespace = namespace\n        self.pod_name = pod_name\n        self.duration = duration\n\n    def test_pod_running_state(self):\n        running_count = 0\n        # Check the pod status every second for the specified duration\n        for _ in range(self.duration):\n            try:\n                pod = self.v1.read_namespaced_pod(name=self.pod_name, namespace=self.namespace)\n                if pod.status.phase == 'Running':\n                    running_count += 1\n                print(f\"Pod status: {pod.status.phase}\")\n            except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n                print(f\"Exception when calling CoreV1Api->read_namespaced_pod: {e}\")\n            time.sleep(1)\n        # Calculate the running percentage\n        running_percentage = (running_count / self.duration) * 100\n        print(f\"Pod was running {running_count} out of {self.duration} seconds.\")\n        print(f\"Running percentage: {running_percentage}%\")\n        # Assert that the running percentage meets the threshold\n        assert running_percentage >= 90, f\"Pod running percentage {running_percentage}% is below the threshold of 90%.\"\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test the running state of a Kubernetes Pod.')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=5, help='Duration to check the pod status in seconds')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n    # Create an instance of the test class\n    test = TestPodRunningState(namespace='default', pod_name='example-pod', duration=args.duration)\n    # Run the test\n    test.test_pod_running_state()\n\n```2nd steady states:\n- Name: example-service-availability\n- Description: The next issue to address is the lack of redundancy due to the use of a single Pod without a controller like Deployment or ReplicaSet. This can lead to a lack of automatic recovery if the Pod fails. To verify the system's resilience, we should define a steady state that measures the availability of the service provided by the Pod. Since the Service 'example-service' is responsible for exposing the Pod, we can measure the service's availability by checking the response time or success rate of HTTP requests to the service. This steady state is specific to the 'nginx/service.yaml' manifest, which defines the Service that forwards traffic to the Pod.\n- Threshold for the steady state: HTTP request success rate >= 99%; The steady state we are considering is the availability of the 'example-service', which is measured by the success rate of HTTP requests. The k6 test results show that 100% of the requests returned a status of 200, indicating that the service is fully available. To define a reasonable threshold, we should consider a success rate that accounts for minor fluctuations or transient issues that might occur in a real-world scenario. A success rate of 99% is a common threshold for availability, allowing for some tolerance while still ensuring high availability. This threshold is also satisfied by the current state, which shows a 100% success rate.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following K6 Javascript:\n```\nimport http from 'k6/http';\nimport { check } from 'k6';\n\nexport const options = {\n  vus: 1,\n  duration: '5s',\n  thresholds: {\n    // Define a threshold for the success rate of HTTP requests\n    'http_req_failed': ['rate<=0.01'], // This ensures that the failure rate is 1% or less, meaning the success rate is 99% or more\n  },\n};\n\nexport default function () {\n  const res = http.get('http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:80');\n  check(res, {\n    'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,\n  });\n}\n\n```\n\n# A fault scenario that may occur in my system and may affect the steady states:\n\nAn assumed fault scenario is as follows:\n- Event: Cyber Attack Simulation\n- Used Chaos Engineering tool: Chaos Mesh\n- Faults to simulate the event: [[Fault(name='PodChaos', name_id=0, params={'action': 'pod-kill', 'mode': 'one', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}})], [Fault(name='NetworkChaos', name_id=1, params={'action': 'delay', 'direction': 'to', 'mode': 'all', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}, 'delay': {'latency': '100ms', 'jitter': '10ms'}})]]\n- Description: Given the system's weaknesses, a cyber attack simulation can be impactful. The system has a single Pod with a 'Never' restart policy, making it vulnerable to downtime if the Pod fails. Additionally, the lack of redundancy means that any failure in the Pod will directly affect the service availability. To simulate a cyber attack, we can start by injecting a 'PodChaos' fault to kill the Pod, testing the system's ability to maintain the 'example-pod-running' steady state. This will reveal the impact of the Pod's restart policy and lack of redundancy. Next, we can inject a 'NetworkChaos' fault to introduce network latency, simulating a DDoS attack, and testing the 'example-service-availability' steady state. This will reveal how the system handles network disruptions and whether the service can maintain a high success rate under stress. The sequence of injecting Pod failure first, followed by network latency, simulates a scenario where an attacker first disrupts the Pod and then targets the network, maximizing the impact on the system.\n\n# Please follow the instructions below regarding Chaos Engineering as necessary:\n- The Chaos-Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute.\n\nNow, please plan a Chaos Engineering experiment to check the network system's resiliency that the steady states are remained during fault injection.\nAI: ```json\n{\"thought\":"

The pod.yaml file specifies a pod running an Nginx container, and the service.yaml file sets up a service to expose this pod on port 80. The use of the Nginx image and the exposure of port 80, which is the default HTTP port, strongly suggest that this setup is intended to serve web content. The file names and the use of Nginx, a popular web server, further support this assumption.\n\n# Steady states of my system:\n2 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: example-pod-running\n- Description: The first issue to address is the Pod's restart policy set to 'Never', which means the Pod will not restart automatically if it fails. This is a critical issue because it can lead to downtime if the Pod encounters any failure. Therefore, the steady state should verify that the Pod is running and has not failed. This can be measured by checking the Pod's status to ensure it is in the 'Running' state. This steady state is specific to the 'nginx/pod.yaml' manifest, which defines the Pod with the problematic restart policy.\n- Threshold for the steady state: The Pod should be in the 'Running' state at least 90% of the time during the observation period.; The steady state we are considering is that the Pod should be in the 'Running' state. The current state shows that the Pod was running 5 out of 5 seconds, which indicates a 100% uptime during the observation period. Given that the Chaos Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute, we can set a threshold that allows for some minor fluctuations but still ensures high availability. A reasonable threshold would be that the Pod should be in the 'Running' state at least 90% of the time during the observation period. This allows for brief interruptions or delays in status updates while still maintaining a high level of reliability.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestPodRunningState(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self, namespace, pod_name, duration):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.namespace = namespace\n        self.pod_name = pod_name\n        self.duration = duration\n\n    def test_pod_running_state(self):\n        running_count = 0\n        # Check the pod status every second for the specified duration\n        for _ in range(self.duration):\n            try:\n                pod = self.v1.read_namespaced_pod(name=self.pod_name, namespace=self.namespace)\n                if pod.status.phase == 'Running':\n                    running_count += 1\n                print(f\"Pod status: {pod.status.phase}\")\n            except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n                print(f\"Exception when calling CoreV1Api->read_namespaced_pod: {e}\")\n            time.sleep(1)\n        # Calculate the running percentage\n        running_percentage = (running_count / self.duration) * 100\n        print(f\"Pod was running {running_count} out of {self.duration} seconds.\")\n        print(f\"Running percentage: {running_percentage}%\")\n        # Assert that the running percentage meets the threshold\n        assert running_percentage >= 90, f\"Pod running percentage {running_percentage}% is below the threshold of 90%.\"\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test the running state of a Kubernetes Pod.')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=5, help='Duration to check the pod status in seconds')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n    # Create an instance of the test class\n    test = TestPodRunningState(namespace='default', pod_name='example-pod', duration=args.duration)\n    # Run the test\n    test.test_pod_running_state()\n\n```2nd steady states:\n- Name: example-service-availability\n- Description: The next issue to address is the lack of redundancy due to the use of a single Pod without a controller like Deployment or ReplicaSet. This can lead to a lack of automatic recovery if the Pod fails. To verify the system's resilience, we should define a steady state that measures the availability of the service provided by the Pod. Since the Service 'example-service' is responsible for exposing the Pod, we can measure the service's availability by checking the response time or success rate of HTTP requests to the service. This steady state is specific to the 'nginx/service.yaml' manifest, which defines the Service that forwards traffic to the Pod.\n- Threshold for the steady state: HTTP request success rate >= 99%; The steady state we are considering is the availability of the 'example-service', which is measured by the success rate of HTTP requests. The k6 test results show that 100% of the requests returned a status of 200, indicating that the service is fully available. To define a reasonable threshold, we should consider a success rate that accounts for minor fluctuations or transient issues that might occur in a real-world scenario. A success rate of 99% is a common threshold for availability, allowing for some tolerance while still ensuring high availability. This threshold is also satisfied by the current state, which shows a 100% success rate.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following K6 Javascript:\n```\nimport http from 'k6/http';\nimport { check } from 'k6';\n\nexport const options = {\n  vus: 1,\n  duration: '5s',\n  thresholds: {\n    // Define a threshold for the success rate of HTTP requests\n    'http_req_failed': ['rate<=0.01'], // This ensures that the failure rate is 1% or less, meaning the success rate is 99% or more\n  },\n};\n\nexport default function () {\n  const res = http.get('http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:80');\n  check(res, {\n    'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,\n  });\n}\n\n```\n\n# A fault scenario that may occur in my system and may affect the steady states:\n\nAn assumed fault scenario is as follows:\n- Event: Cyber Attack Simulation\n- Used Chaos Engineering tool: Chaos Mesh\n- Faults to simulate the event: [[Fault(name='PodChaos', name_id=0, params={'action': 'pod-kill', 'mode': 'one', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}})], [Fault(name='NetworkChaos', name_id=1, params={'action': 'delay', 'direction': 'to', 'mode': 'all', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}, 'delay': {'latency': '100ms', 'jitter': '10ms'}})]]\n- Description: Given the system's weaknesses, a cyber attack simulation can be impactful. The system has a single Pod with a 'Never' restart policy, making it vulnerable to downtime if the Pod fails. Additionally, the lack of redundancy means that any failure in the Pod will directly affect the service availability. To simulate a cyber attack, we can start by injecting a 'PodChaos' fault to kill the Pod, testing the system's ability to maintain the 'example-pod-running' steady state. This will reveal the impact of the Pod's restart policy and lack of redundancy. Next, we can inject a 'NetworkChaos' fault to introduce network latency, simulating a DDoS attack, and testing the 'example-service-availability' steady state. This will reveal how the system handles network disruptions and whether the service can maintain a high success rate under stress. The sequence of injecting Pod failure first, followed by network latency, simulates a scenario where an attacker first disrupts the Pod and then targets the network, maximizing the impact on the system.\n\n# Please follow the instructions below regarding Chaos Engineering as necessary:\n- The Chaos-Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute.\n\nNow, please detail the fault-injection phase.

The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"summary\": {\"title\": \"Summary\", \"description\": \"The summary of the given Chaos-Engineering-experiment plan.\", \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"required\": [\"summary\"]}\n```\n\nHuman: # Here is my Chaos-Engineering-experiment plan:\n## Time Schedule\nGiven the constraints and the nature of the system, we need to design a Chaos Engineering experiment that fits within a 1-minute timeframe. The experiment will be divided into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation. The pre-validation phase will ensure that the system is in a steady state before any faults are injected. This involves checking that the Pod is running and the service is available. The fault-injection phase will simulate a cyber attack by first killing the Pod and then introducing network latency. This will test the system's resilience to these faults. Finally, the post-validation phase will verify that the system returns to its steady states after the faults are removed. Given the 1-minute constraint, a reasonable time allocation would be 15 seconds for pre-validation, 30 seconds for fault injection, and 15 seconds for post-validation. This allows enough time to observe the system's behavior during each phase while staying within the overall time limit.\n\n## Pre-validation Phase\nIn the pre-validation phase, we need to ensure that the system is in its expected steady states before we proceed with fault injection. Given the constraints, we have 15 seconds to perform these checks. We have two steady states to verify: 'example-pod-running' and 'example-service-availability'. To efficiently utilize the time, we will run both unit tests simultaneously. This approach allows us to maximize the use of the available time and ensure that both steady states are verified within the 15-second window. The 'example-pod-running' test will check if the Pod is in the 'Running' state for at least 90% of the time, while the 'example-service-availability' test will verify that the HTTP request success rate is at least 99%. By running these tests concurrently, we can quickly confirm that the system is stable and ready for the fault injection phase.\n- Verified Steady State #0: ```example-pod-running```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```pre-unittest-example-pod-running```  \n  - Grace Period: ```0s```  \n  - Duration: ```15s```  \n- Verified Steady State #1: ```example-service-availability```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```pre-unittest-example-service-availability```  \n  - Grace Period: ```0s```  \n  - Duration: ```15s```  \n\n\n## Fault-injection Phase \nIn this fault-injection phase, we aim to simulate a cyber attack scenario by injecting two types of faults: 'PodChaos' and 'NetworkChaos'. The goal is to observe the system's behavior under these conditions and assess its resilience. Given the 30-second time constraint for this phase, we need to carefully schedule the fault injections and unit tests to maximize the insights gained while ensuring the experiment remains within the allotted time.\n\nThe approach is to stagger the fault injections and unit tests to observe the system's response to each fault type separately. We will start with the 'PodChaos' fault, which will kill the Pod, and then follow with the 'NetworkChaos' fault, which introduces network latency. This sequence simulates an attack where the Pod is disrupted first, followed by network interference.\n\nThe 'PodChaos' fault will be injected at the beginning of the phase, with a short duration to allow time for the system to react. Immediately after the 'PodChaos' fault, we will run the unit test for the 'example-pod-running' steady state to verify if the Pod remains in the 'Running' state despite the fault. This test will help us understand the impact of the Pod's restart policy and lack of redundancy.\n\nNext, we will inject the 'NetworkChaos' fault, which introduces network latency. After this fault is injected, we will run the unit test for the 'example-service-availability' steady state to check if the service can maintain a high success rate under network stress. This test will reveal how the system handles network disruptions.\n\nBy staggering the fault injections and unit tests, we can isolate the effects of each fault and gain a clearer understanding of the system's resilience. The timing is designed to ensure that each fault and test fits within the 30-second phase, allowing us to complete the experiment efficiently.\n- Verified Steady State #0: ```example-pod-running```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```fault-unittest-example-pod-running```  \n  - Grace Period: ```10s```  \n  - Duration: ```5s```  \n- Verified Steady State #1: ```example-service-availability```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```fault-unittest-example-service-availability```  \n  - Grace Period: ```25s```  \n  - Duration: ```5s```  \n\n\n- Injected Faults #0: ```PodChaos```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```fault-podchaos```  \n  - Grace Period: ```0s```  \n  - Duration: ```10s```  \n- Injected Faults #1: ```NetworkChaos```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```fault-networkchaos```  \n  - Grace Period: ```15s```  \n  - Duration: ```10s```  \n\n\n## Post-validation phase\nIn the post-validation phase, we need to ensure that the system has returned to its steady states after the fault injection. Given the 15-second time constraint, we will conduct unit tests to verify each steady state. The tests will be executed sequentially due to the short duration, allowing us to focus on one steady state at a time and ensure accurate validation. The first test will check the 'example-pod-running' steady state, ensuring the Pod is back in the 'Running' state. The second test will verify the 'example-service-availability' steady state, ensuring the service is available with a high success rate. Each test will have a brief grace period to allow the system to stabilize after the fault injection, followed by a short duration to perform the validation.\n- Verified Steady State #0: ```example-pod-running```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```post-unittest-example-pod-running```  \n  - Grace Period: ```0s```  \n  - Duration: ```7s```  \n- Verified Steady State #1: ```example-service-availability```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```post-unittest-example-service-availability```  \n  - Grace Period: ```7s```  \n  - Duration: ```8s```  \n\n\nPlease summarize the above plan.\n\nAI: ```json\n{\"summary\":"
