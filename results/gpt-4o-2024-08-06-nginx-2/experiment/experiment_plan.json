        "thought": "Given the constraints and the nature of the system, we need to design a Chaos Engineering experiment that fits within a 1-minute timeframe. The experiment will be divided into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation. The pre-validation phase will ensure that the system is in a steady state before any faults are injected. This involves checking that the Pod is running and the service is available. The fault-injection phase will simulate a cyber attack by first killing the Pod and then introducing network latency. This will test the system's resilience to these faults. Finally, the post-validation phase will verify that the system returns to its steady states after the faults are removed. Given the 1-minute constraint, a reasonable time allocation would be 15 seconds for pre-validation, 30 seconds for fault injection, and 15 seconds for post-validation. This allows enough time to observe the system's behavior during each phase while staying within the overall time limit.",

To efficiently utilize the time, we will run both unit tests simultaneously. This approach allows us to maximize the use of the available time and ensure that both steady states are verified within the 15-second window. The 'example-pod-running' test will check if the Pod is in the 'Running' state for at least 90% of the time, while the 'example-service-availability' test will verify that the HTTP request success rate is at least 99%.

        "thought": "In this fault-injection phase, we aim to simulate a cyber attack scenario by injecting two types of faults: 'PodChaos' and 'NetworkChaos'. The goal is to observe the system's behavior under these conditions and assess its resilience. Given the 30-second time constraint for this phase, we need to carefully schedule the fault injections and unit tests to maximize the insights gained while ensuring the experiment remains within the allotted time.\n\nThe approach is to stagger the fault injections and unit tests to observe the system's response to each fault type separately. We will start with the 'PodChaos' fault, which will kill the Pod, and then follow with the 'NetworkChaos' fault, which introduces network latency. This sequence simulates an attack where the Pod is disrupted first, followed by network interference.\n\nThe 'PodChaos' fault will be injected at the beginning of the phase, with a short duration to allow time for the system to react. Immediately after the 'PodChaos' fault, we will run the unit test for the 'example-pod-running' steady state to verify if the Pod remains in the 'Running' state despite the fault. This test will help us understand the impact of the Pod's restart policy and lack of redundancy.\n\nNext, we will inject the 'NetworkChaos' fault, which introduces network latency. After this fault is injected, we will run the unit test for the 'example-service-availability' steady state to check if the service can maintain a high success rate under network stress. This test will reveal how the system handles network disruptions.\n\nBy staggering the fault injections and unit tests, we can isolate the effects of each fault and gain a clearer understanding of the system's resilience. The timing is designed to ensure that each fault and test fits within the 30-second phase, allowing us to complete the experiment efficiently.",

    "summary": "The Chaos Engineering experiment is structured into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation, all within a 1-minute timeframe. \n\nIn the pre-validation phase, which lasts for 15 seconds, two unit tests are executed simultaneously to verify the system's steady state. The 'example-pod-running' test, with the workflow name 'pre-unittest-example-pod-running', and the 'example-service-availability' test, with the workflow name 'pre-unittest-example-service-availability', both start immediately at the beginning of this phase and run for the entire 15 seconds. These tests ensure that the Pod is running and the service is available before proceeding to fault injection.\n\nThe fault-injection phase spans 30 seconds and involves staggered execution of faults and unit tests. Initially, the 'PodChaos' fault, with the workflow name 'fault-podchaos', is injected at the start of this phase and lasts for 10 seconds. Concurrently, at 10 seconds into the phase, the 'example-pod-running' unit test, with the workflow name 'fault-unittest-example-pod-running', is conducted for 5 seconds to assess the Pod's resilience. Following this, at 15 seconds, the 'NetworkChaos' fault, with the workflow name 'fault-networkchaos', is introduced for 10 seconds. Subsequently, at 25 seconds, the 'example-service-availability' unit test, with the workflow name 'fault-unittest-example-service-availability', is executed for 5 seconds to evaluate the service's performance under network stress.\n\nIn the post-validation phase, which also lasts 15 seconds, unit tests are performed sequentially to confirm the system's return to steady states. The 'example-pod-running' test, with the workflow name 'post-unittest-example-pod-running', starts immediately and runs for 7 seconds. Following this, the 'example-service-availability' test, with the workflow name 'post-unittest-example-service-availability', begins at 7 seconds and continues for the remaining 8 seconds. This phase ensures that both the Pod and service have stabilized after the fault injections."
