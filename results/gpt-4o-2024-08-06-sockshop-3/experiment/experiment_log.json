The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"thought\": {\"title\": \"Thought\", \"describe\": \"Think about the total time and the reasonable time allocation for each phase that you are about to design, and explain your thought process in detail.\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"total_time\": {\"title\": \"Total Time\", \"description\": \"Total time of the entire chaos experiment. total_time should equal to the sum of pre_validation_time, fault_injection_time, and post_validation_time.\", \"example\": \"10m\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"pre_validation_time\": {\"title\": \"Pre Validation Time\", \"description\": \"Total time of validation before fault injection.\", \"example\": \"2m\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"fault_injection_time\": {\"title\": \"Fault Injection Time\", \"description\": \"Total time of fault injection.\", \"example\": \"6m\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"post_validation_time\": {\"title\": \"Post Validation Time\", \"description\": \"Total time of validation after fault injection.\", \"example\": \"2m\", \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"required\": [\"thought\", \"total_time\", \"pre_validation_time\", \"fault_injection_time\", \"post_validation_time\"]}\n```\nHuman: # Here is the overview of my system:\nThe system consists of the following K8s manifest(s):K8s manifest: sock-shop-2/manifests/00-sock-shop-ns.yaml\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Namespace\nmetadata:\n  name: sock-shop\n\n```\nSummary of sock-shop-2/manifests/00-sock-shop-ns.yaml:\n- This manifest defines a Kubernetes Namespace.\n- The Namespace is named 'sock-shop'.\n- Namespaces are used to organize and manage resources within a Kubernetes cluster.\n\nK8s manifest: sock-shop-2/manifests/01-carts-dep.yaml\n```yaml\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: carts\n  labels:\n    name: carts\n  namespace: sock-shop\nspec:\n  replicas: 2\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      name: carts\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        name: carts\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      -

It provides functionalities such as browsing a catalogue, managing a shopping cart, placing orders, processing payments, handling shipping, and managing user accounts.; The manifests provided are part of a well-known microservices demo application called 'Sock Shop'. This application is designed to demonstrate the use of microservices architecture and Kubernetes. The application simulates an e-commerce website for selling socks, and the manifests include various components such as front-end, back-end services, databases, and messaging systems. The naming conventions, such as 'carts', 'catalogue', 'orders', 'payment', 'shipping', and 'user', align with typical e-commerce functionalities. Additionally, the use of images from 'weaveworksdemos' further indicates that this is the Sock Shop demo application.\n\n# Steady states of my system:\n2 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: carts-db-replicas-running\n- Description: The first issue to address is the 'Missing Resource Requests' in the 'carts-db' Deployment. This is a critical issue because without resource requests, the pods may not be scheduled if the cluster is under resource constraints, leading to potential downtime. The steady state for this manifest should ensure that the 'carts-db' pods are running and available, which can be measured by checking the number of replicas that are in the 'Running' state.\n- Threshold for the steady state: The 'carts-db' replicas must be ready for at least 90% of the time during a 1-minute monitoring period, which equates to at least 54 out of 60 seconds.; The steady state we are considering is the number of 'carts-db' replicas that are running and ready. The current state shows that there are 2 replicas, and both are ready, which is the expected state. Given that the deployment specifies 2 replicas, the threshold should ensure that both replicas are running and ready. To account for some fluctuations and ensure the system remains stable, we can define a threshold that allows for a small percentage of time where not all replicas are ready, as long as the system recovers quickly. Since the experiment duration is 1 minute, we can set a threshold that requires the 'carts-db' replicas to be ready for at least 90% of the time during this period. This means that out of 60 seconds, the replicas should be ready for at least 54 seconds. This threshold provides a reasonable tolerance for transient issues while ensuring the system remains stable.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestCartsDBReplicas(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.v1_apps = client.AppsV1Api()\n\n    def check_carts_db_replicas(self, namespace='sock-shop', deployment_name='carts-db'):\n        try:\n            deployment = self.v1_apps.read_namespaced_deployment(name=deployment_name, namespace=namespace)\n            replicas = deployment.status.replicas\n            ready_replicas = deployment.status.ready_replicas\n            print(f\"Total replicas: {replicas}, Ready replicas: {ready_replicas}\")\n            return ready_replicas == replicas\n        except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n            print(f\"Exception when calling AppsV1Api->read_namespaced_deployment: {e}\")\n            return False\n\n    def test_replicas_ready_threshold(self, duration):\n        success_count = 0\n        for _ in range(duration):\n            if self.check_carts_db_replicas():\n                success_count += 1\n            time.sleep(1)\n        # Calculate the threshold as 90% of the duration\n        threshold = 0.9 * duration\n        print(f\"Carts-db replicas running successfully for {success_count}/{duration} seconds.\")\n        # Assert that the success count meets or exceeds the threshold\n        assert success_count >= threshold, f\"Replicas were not ready for at least 90% of the time. Success count: {success_count}, Required: {threshold}\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test carts-db replicas readiness threshold.')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=60, help='Duration to check the state in seconds')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    test = TestCartsDBReplicas()\n    test.test_replicas_ready_threshold(args.duration)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\n```2nd steady states:\n- Name: front-end-replica-running\n- Description: The next issue to address is the 'Single Replica Deployment' in the 'front-end' Deployment. This is a critical issue because having only a single replica can lead to downtime if the pod fails. The steady state for this manifest should ensure that the 'front-end' pod is running and available, which can be measured by checking the number of replicas that are in the 'Running' state. Since there is only one replica, the steady state should ensure that this single replica is running and ready for the entire duration of the monitoring period.\n- Threshold for the steady state: The 'front-end' pod must have at least 1 running and ready replica for 95% of the time within a 1-minute monitoring period.; The steady state we are considering is the availability of the 'front-end' pod, which currently has a single replica. The current state shows that the single replica is consistently running and ready, as indicated by the repeated output of 'Running and ready front-end pods: 1'. Given that the system is expected to maintain this state, the threshold should ensure that the single replica remains running and ready for the entire duration of the monitoring period. Since the monitoring period in the script is 5 seconds, and the Chaos Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute, we can set a threshold that requires the front-end pod to be running and ready for at least 95% of the time during a 1-minute period. This accounts for any minor fluctuations or delays in pod readiness checks.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestFrontEndReplicaRunning(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.namespace = 'sock-shop'\n        self.deployment_name = 'front-end'\n\n    def check_front_end_status(self):\n        # List all pods in the specified namespace with the label 'name=front-end'\n        pods = self.v1.list_namespaced_pod(namespace=self.namespace, label_selector=f'name={self.deployment_name}').items\n        # Filter pods that are in the 'Running' state\n        running_pods = [pod for pod in pods if pod.status.phase == 'Running']\n        # Further filter pods that are ready\n        ready_pods = [pod for pod in running_pods if all(container.ready for container in pod.status.container_statuses)]\n        return len(ready_pods)\n\n    def test_steady_state(self, duration):\n        successful_checks = 0\n        total_checks = duration\n\n        for _ in range(duration):\n            running_and_ready = self.check_front_end_status()\n            print(f'Running and ready front-end pods: {running_and_ready}')\n            if running_and_ready >= 1:\n                successful_checks += 1\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the percentage of successful checks\n        success_rate = (successful_checks / total_checks) * 100\n        print(f'Success rate: {success_rate}%')\n\n        # Assert that the success rate is at least 95%\n        assert success_rate >= 95, f'Success rate {success_rate}% is below the threshold of 95%'\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test front-end pod steady state.')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=60, help='Duration to check the status in seconds')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    test = TestFrontEndReplicaRunning()\n    test.test_steady_state(args.duration)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\n```\n\n# A fault scenario that may occur in my system and may affect the steady states:\n\nAn assumed fault scenario is as follows:\n- Event: Black Friday Sale\n- Used Chaos Engineering tool: Chaos Mesh\n- Faults to simulate the event: [[Fault(name='StressChaos', name_id=0, params={'mode': 'all', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['sock-shop'], 'labelSelectors': {'name': 'carts-db'}}, 'stressors': {'cpu': {'workers': 2, 'load': 80}, 'memory': {'workers': 2, 'size': '256MB'}}, 'containerNames': ['carts-db']})], [Fault(name='PodChaos', name_id=0, params={'action': 'pod-kill', 'mode': 'one', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['sock-shop'], 'labelSelectors': {'name': 'front-end'}}, 'value': '1'})]]\n- Description: During a Black Friday sale, the system is expected to handle a significant increase in traffic and load. This event will test the system's ability to maintain steady states under high demand. The 'carts-db' and 'front-end' components are critical to the user experience, as they handle shopping cart operations and the user interface, respectively. The 'carts-db' deployment lacks resource requests, which could lead to scheduling issues under resource constraints. The 'front-end' deployment has a single replica, making it vulnerable to downtime if the pod fails. To simulate the Black Friday event, we will first inject a StressChaos fault to increase CPU and memory usage on the 'carts-db' pods, testing their ability to remain running without resource requests. Next, we will inject a PodChaos fault to kill the 'front-end' pod, testing the system's ability to recover and maintain availability with a single replica. This sequence of fault injections will reveal potential weaknesses in resource allocation and redundancy, ensuring the system can handle the increased load and maintain steady states.\n\n# Please follow the instructions below regarding Chaos Engineering as necessary:\n- The Chaos-Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute.\n- When using k6 in steady-state definition, always select a request URL from the specified options.\n\nNow, please plan a Chaos Engineering experiment to check the network system's resiliency that the steady states are remained during fault injection.\nAI: ```json\n{\"thought\":"

We will verify that the 'carts-db' replicas are running and ready for at least 90% of the time, and the 'front-end' replica is running and ready for at least 95% of the time.

It provides functionalities such as browsing a catalogue, managing a shopping cart, placing orders, processing payments, handling shipping, and managing user accounts.; The manifests provided are part of a well-known microservices demo application called 'Sock Shop'. This application is designed to demonstrate the use of microservices architecture and Kubernetes. The application simulates an e-commerce website for selling socks, and the manifests include various components such as front-end, back-end services, databases, and messaging systems. The naming conventions, such as 'carts', 'catalogue', 'orders', 'payment', 'shipping', and 'user', align with typical e-commerce functionalities. Additionally, the use of images from 'weaveworksdemos' further indicates that this is the Sock Shop demo application.\n\n# Steady states of my system:\n2 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: carts-db-replicas-running\n- Description: The first issue to address is the 'Missing Resource Requests' in the 'carts-db' Deployment. This is a critical issue because without resource requests, the pods may not be scheduled if the cluster is under resource constraints, leading to potential downtime. The steady state for this manifest should ensure that the 'carts-db' pods are running and available, which can be measured by checking the number of replicas that are in the 'Running' state.\n- Threshold for the steady state: The 'carts-db' replicas must be ready for at least 90% of the time during a 1-minute monitoring period, which equates to at least 54 out of 60 seconds.; The steady state we are considering is the number of 'carts-db' replicas that are running and ready. The current state shows that there are 2 replicas, and both are ready, which is the expected state. Given that the deployment specifies 2 replicas, the threshold should ensure that both replicas are running and ready. To account for some fluctuations and ensure the system remains stable, we can define a threshold that allows for a small percentage of time where not all replicas are ready, as long as the system recovers quickly. Since the experiment duration is 1 minute, we can set a threshold that requires the 'carts-db' replicas to be ready for at least 90% of the time during this period. This means that out of 60 seconds, the replicas should be ready for at least 54 seconds. This threshold provides a reasonable tolerance for transient issues while ensuring the system remains stable.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestCartsDBReplicas(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.v1_apps = client.AppsV1Api()\n\n    def check_carts_db_replicas(self, namespace='sock-shop', deployment_name='carts-db'):\n        try:\n            deployment = self.v1_apps.read_namespaced_deployment(name=deployment_name, namespace=namespace)\n            replicas = deployment.status.replicas\n            ready_replicas = deployment.status.ready_replicas\n            print(f\"Total replicas: {replicas}, Ready replicas: {ready_replicas}\")\n            return ready_replicas == replicas\n        except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n            print(f\"Exception when calling AppsV1Api->read_namespaced_deployment: {e}\")\n            return False\n\n    def test_replicas_ready_threshold(self, duration):\n        success_count = 0\n        for _ in range(duration):\n            if self.check_carts_db_replicas():\n                success_count += 1\n            time.sleep(1)\n        # Calculate the threshold as 90% of the duration\n        threshold = 0.9 * duration\n        print(f\"Carts-db replicas running successfully for {success_count}/{duration} seconds.\")\n        # Assert that the success count meets or exceeds the threshold\n        assert success_count >= threshold, f\"Replicas were not ready for at least 90% of the time. Success count: {success_count}, Required: {threshold}\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test carts-db replicas readiness threshold.')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=60, help='Duration to check the state in seconds')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    test = TestCartsDBReplicas()\n    test.test_replicas_ready_threshold(args.duration)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\n```2nd steady states:\n- Name: front-end-replica-running\n- Description: The next issue to address is the 'Single Replica Deployment' in the 'front-end' Deployment. This is a critical issue because having only a single replica can lead to downtime if the pod fails. The steady state for this manifest should ensure that the 'front-end' pod is running and available, which can be measured by checking the number of replicas that are in the 'Running' state. Since there is only one replica, the steady state should ensure that this single replica is running and ready for the entire duration of the monitoring period.\n- Threshold for the steady state: The 'front-end' pod must have at least 1 running and ready replica for 95% of the time within a 1-minute monitoring period.; The steady state we are considering is the availability of the 'front-end' pod, which currently has a single replica. The current state shows that the single replica is consistently running and ready, as indicated by the repeated output of 'Running and ready front-end pods: 1'. Given that the system is expected to maintain this state, the threshold should ensure that the single replica remains running and ready for the entire duration of the monitoring period. Since the monitoring period in the script is 5 seconds, and the Chaos Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute, we can set a threshold that requires the front-end pod to be running and ready for at least 95% of the time during a 1-minute period. This accounts for any minor fluctuations or delays in pod readiness checks.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestFrontEndReplicaRunning(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.namespace = 'sock-shop'\n        self.deployment_name = 'front-end'\n\n    def check_front_end_status(self):\n        # List all pods in the specified namespace with the label 'name=front-end'\n        pods = self.v1.list_namespaced_pod(namespace=self.namespace, label_selector=f'name={self.deployment_name}').items\n        # Filter pods that are in the 'Running' state\n        running_pods = [pod for pod in pods if pod.status.phase == 'Running']\n        # Further filter pods that are ready\n        ready_pods = [pod for pod in running_pods if all(container.ready for container in pod.status.container_statuses)]\n        return len(ready_pods)\n\n    def test_steady_state(self, duration):\n        successful_checks = 0\n        total_checks = duration\n\n        for _ in range(duration):\n            running_and_ready = self.check_front_end_status()\n            print(f'Running and ready front-end pods: {running_and_ready}')\n            if running_and_ready >= 1:\n                successful_checks += 1\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the percentage of successful checks\n        success_rate = (successful_checks / total_checks) * 100\n        print(f'Success rate: {success_rate}%')\n\n        # Assert that the success rate is at least 95%\n        assert success_rate >= 95, f'Success rate {success_rate}% is below the threshold of 95%'\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test front-end pod steady state.')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=60, help='Duration to check the status in seconds')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    test = TestFrontEndReplicaRunning()\n    test.test_steady_state(args.duration)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\n```\n\n# A fault scenario that may occur in my system and may affect the steady states:\n\nAn assumed fault scenario is as follows:\n- Event: Black Friday Sale\n- Used Chaos Engineering tool: Chaos Mesh\n- Faults to simulate the event: [[Fault(name='StressChaos', name_id=0, params={'mode': 'all', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['sock-shop'], 'labelSelectors': {'name': 'carts-db'}}, 'stressors': {'cpu': {'workers': 2, 'load': 80}, 'memory': {'workers': 2, 'size': '256MB'}}, 'containerNames': ['carts-db']})], [Fault(name='PodChaos', name_id=0, params={'action': 'pod-kill', 'mode': 'one', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['sock-shop'], 'labelSelectors': {'name': 'front-end'}}, 'value': '1'})]]\n- Description: During a Black Friday sale, the system is expected to handle a significant increase in traffic and load. This event will test the system's ability to maintain steady states under high demand. The 'carts-db' and 'front-end' components are critical to the user experience, as they handle shopping cart operations and the user interface, respectively. The 'carts-db' deployment lacks resource requests, which could lead to scheduling issues under resource constraints. The 'front-end' deployment has a single replica, making it vulnerable to downtime if the pod fails. To simulate the Black Friday event, we will first inject a StressChaos fault to increase CPU and memory usage on the 'carts-db' pods, testing their ability to remain running without resource requests. Next, we will inject a PodChaos fault to kill the 'front-end' pod, testing the system's ability to recover and maintain availability with a single replica. This sequence of fault injections will reveal potential weaknesses in resource allocation and redundancy, ensuring the system can handle the increased load and maintain steady states.\n\n# Please follow the instructions below regarding Chaos Engineering as necessary:\n- The Chaos-Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute.\n- When using k6 in steady-state definition, always select a request URL from the specified options.\n\nNow, please detail the pre-validation phase.

It provides functionalities such as browsing a catalogue, managing a shopping cart, placing orders, processing payments, handling shipping, and managing user accounts.; The manifests provided are part of a well-known microservices demo application called 'Sock Shop'. This application is designed to demonstrate the use of microservices architecture and Kubernetes. The application simulates an e-commerce website for selling socks, and the manifests include various components such as front-end, back-end services, databases, and messaging systems. The naming conventions, such as 'carts', 'catalogue', 'orders', 'payment', 'shipping', and 'user', align with typical e-commerce functionalities. Additionally, the use of images from 'weaveworksdemos' further indicates that this is the Sock Shop demo application.\n\n# Steady states of my system:\n2 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: carts-db-replicas-running\n- Description: The first issue to address is the 'Missing Resource Requests' in the 'carts-db' Deployment. This is a critical issue because without resource requests, the pods may not be scheduled if the cluster is under resource constraints, leading to potential downtime. The steady state for this manifest should ensure that the 'carts-db' pods are running and available, which can be measured by checking the number of replicas that are in the 'Running' state.\n- Threshold for the steady state: The 'carts-db' replicas must be ready for at least 90% of the time during a 1-minute monitoring period, which equates to at least 54 out of 60 seconds.; The steady state we are considering is the number of 'carts-db' replicas that are running and ready. The current state shows that there are 2 replicas, and both are ready, which is the expected state. Given that the deployment specifies 2 replicas, the threshold should ensure that both replicas are running and ready. To account for some fluctuations and ensure the system remains stable, we can define a threshold that allows for a small percentage of time where not all replicas are ready, as long as the system recovers quickly. Since the experiment duration is 1 minute, we can set a threshold that requires the 'carts-db' replicas to be ready for at least 90% of the time during this period. This means that out of 60 seconds, the replicas should be ready for at least 54 seconds. This threshold provides a reasonable tolerance for transient issues while ensuring the system remains stable.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestCartsDBReplicas(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.v1_apps = client.AppsV1Api()\n\n    def check_carts_db_replicas(self, namespace='sock-shop', deployment_name='carts-db'):\n        try:\n            deployment = self.v1_apps.read_namespaced_deployment(name=deployment_name, namespace=namespace)\n            replicas = deployment.status.replicas\n            ready_replicas = deployment.status.ready_replicas\n            print(f\"Total replicas: {replicas}, Ready replicas: {ready_replicas}\")\n            return ready_replicas == replicas\n        except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n            print(f\"Exception when calling AppsV1Api->read_namespaced_deployment: {e}\")\n            return False\n\n    def test_replicas_ready_threshold(self, duration):\n        success_count = 0\n        for _ in range(duration):\n            if self.check_carts_db_replicas():\n                success_count += 1\n            time.sleep(1)\n        # Calculate the threshold as 90% of the duration\n        threshold = 0.9 * duration\n        print(f\"Carts-db replicas running successfully for {success_count}/{duration} seconds.\")\n        # Assert that the success count meets or exceeds the threshold\n        assert success_count >= threshold, f\"Replicas were not ready for at least 90% of the time. Success count: {success_count}, Required: {threshold}\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test carts-db replicas readiness threshold.')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=60, help='Duration to check the state in seconds')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    test = TestCartsDBReplicas()\n    test.test_replicas_ready_threshold(args.duration)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\n```2nd steady states:\n- Name: front-end-replica-running\n- Description: The next issue to address is the 'Single Replica Deployment' in the 'front-end' Deployment. This is a critical issue because having only a single replica can lead to downtime if the pod fails. The steady state for this manifest should ensure that the 'front-end' pod is running and available, which can be measured by checking the number of replicas that are in the 'Running' state. Since there is only one replica, the steady state should ensure that this single replica is running and ready for the entire duration of the monitoring period.\n- Threshold for the steady state: The 'front-end' pod must have at least 1 running and ready replica for 95% of the time within a 1-minute monitoring period.; The steady state we are considering is the availability of the 'front-end' pod, which currently has a single replica. The current state shows that the single replica is consistently running and ready, as indicated by the repeated output of 'Running and ready front-end pods: 1'. Given that the system is expected to maintain this state, the threshold should ensure that the single replica remains running and ready for the entire duration of the monitoring period. Since the monitoring period in the script is 5 seconds, and the Chaos Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute, we can set a threshold that requires the front-end pod to be running and ready for at least 95% of the time during a 1-minute period. This accounts for any minor fluctuations or delays in pod readiness checks.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestFrontEndReplicaRunning(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.namespace = 'sock-shop'\n        self.deployment_name = 'front-end'\n\n    def check_front_end_status(self):\n        # List all pods in the specified namespace with the label 'name=front-end'\n        pods = self.v1.list_namespaced_pod(namespace=self.namespace, label_selector=f'name={self.deployment_name}').items\n        # Filter pods that are in the 'Running' state\n        running_pods = [pod for pod in pods if pod.status.phase == 'Running']\n        # Further filter pods that are ready\n        ready_pods = [pod for pod in running_pods if all(container.ready for container in pod.status.container_statuses)]\n        return len(ready_pods)\n\n    def test_steady_state(self, duration):\n        successful_checks = 0\n        total_checks = duration\n\n        for _ in range(duration):\n            running_and_ready = self.check_front_end_status()\n            print(f'Running and ready front-end pods: {running_and_ready}')\n            if running_and_ready >= 1:\n                successful_checks += 1\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the percentage of successful checks\n        success_rate = (successful_checks / total_checks) * 100\n        print(f'Success rate: {success_rate}%')\n\n        # Assert that the success rate is at least 95%\n        assert success_rate >= 95, f'Success rate {success_rate}% is below the threshold of 95%'\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test front-end pod steady state.')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=60, help='Duration to check the status in seconds')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    test = TestFrontEndReplicaRunning()\n    test.test_steady_state(args.duration)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\n```\n\n# A fault scenario that may occur in my system and may affect the steady states:\n\nAn assumed fault scenario is as follows:\n- Event: Black Friday Sale\n- Used Chaos Engineering tool: Chaos Mesh\n- Faults to simulate the event: [[Fault(name='StressChaos', name_id=0, params={'mode': 'all', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['sock-shop'], 'labelSelectors': {'name': 'carts-db'}}, 'stressors': {'cpu': {'workers': 2, 'load': 80}, 'memory': {'workers': 2, 'size': '256MB'}}, 'containerNames': ['carts-db']})], [Fault(name='PodChaos', name_id=0, params={'action': 'pod-kill', 'mode': 'one', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['sock-shop'], 'labelSelectors': {'name': 'front-end'}}, 'value': '1'})]]\n- Description: During a Black Friday sale, the system is expected to handle a significant increase in traffic and load. This event will test the system's ability to maintain steady states under high demand. The 'carts-db' and 'front-end' components are critical to the user experience, as they handle shopping cart operations and the user interface, respectively. The 'carts-db' deployment lacks resource requests, which could lead to scheduling issues under resource constraints. The 'front-end' deployment has a single replica, making it vulnerable to downtime if the pod fails. To simulate the Black Friday event, we will first inject a StressChaos fault to increase CPU and memory usage on the 'carts-db' pods, testing their ability to remain running without resource requests. Next, we will inject a PodChaos fault to kill the 'front-end' pod, testing the system's ability to recover and maintain availability with a single replica. This sequence of fault injections will reveal potential weaknesses in resource allocation and redundancy, ensuring the system can handle the increased load and maintain steady states.\n\n# Please follow the instructions below regarding Chaos Engineering as necessary:\n- The Chaos-Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute.\n- When using k6 in steady-state definition, always select a request URL from the specified options.\n\nNow, please detail the fault-injection phase. Note that the phase's total time is 20s.\nAI: ```json\n{\"thought\":"

This fault will kill the pod, testing the system's ability to recover and maintain availability with a single replica. We will start this fault 10 seconds into the phase (grace period of 10s) and let it run for the remaining 10 seconds.

It provides functionalities such as browsing a catalogue, managing a shopping cart, placing orders, processing payments, handling shipping, and managing user accounts.; The manifests provided are part of a well-known microservices demo application called 'Sock Shop'. This application is designed to demonstrate the use of microservices architecture and Kubernetes. The application simulates an e-commerce website for selling socks, and the manifests include various components such as front-end, back-end services, databases, and messaging systems. The naming conventions, such as 'carts', 'catalogue', 'orders', 'payment', 'shipping', and 'user', align with typical e-commerce functionalities. Additionally, the use of images from 'weaveworksdemos' further indicates that this is the Sock Shop demo application.\n\n# Steady states of my system:\n2 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: carts-db-replicas-running\n- Description: The first issue to address is the 'Missing Resource Requests' in the 'carts-db' Deployment. This is a critical issue because without resource requests, the pods may not be scheduled if the cluster is under resource constraints, leading to potential downtime. The steady state for this manifest should ensure that the 'carts-db' pods are running and available, which can be measured by checking the number of replicas that are in the 'Running' state.\n- Threshold for the steady state: The 'carts-db' replicas must be ready for at least 90% of the time during a 1-minute monitoring period, which equates to at least 54 out of 60 seconds.; The steady state we are considering is the number of 'carts-db' replicas that are running and ready. The current state shows that there are 2 replicas, and both are ready, which is the expected state. Given that the deployment specifies 2 replicas, the threshold should ensure that both replicas are running and ready. To account for some fluctuations and ensure the system remains stable, we can define a threshold that allows for a small percentage of time where not all replicas are ready, as long as the system recovers quickly. Since the experiment duration is 1 minute, we can set a threshold that requires the 'carts-db' replicas to be ready for at least 90% of the time during this period. This means that out of 60 seconds, the replicas should be ready for at least 54 seconds. This threshold provides a reasonable tolerance for transient issues while ensuring the system remains stable.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestCartsDBReplicas(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.v1_apps = client.AppsV1Api()\n\n    def check_carts_db_replicas(self, namespace='sock-shop', deployment_name='carts-db'):\n        try:\n            deployment = self.v1_apps.read_namespaced_deployment(name=deployment_name, namespace=namespace)\n            replicas = deployment.status.replicas\n            ready_replicas = deployment.status.ready_replicas\n            print(f\"Total replicas: {replicas}, Ready replicas: {ready_replicas}\")\n            return ready_replicas == replicas\n        except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n            print(f\"Exception when calling AppsV1Api->read_namespaced_deployment: {e}\")\n            return False\n\n    def test_replicas_ready_threshold(self, duration):\n        success_count = 0\n        for _ in range(duration):\n            if self.check_carts_db_replicas():\n                success_count += 1\n            time.sleep(1)\n        # Calculate the threshold as 90% of the duration\n        threshold = 0.9 * duration\n        print(f\"Carts-db replicas running successfully for {success_count}/{duration} seconds.\")\n        # Assert that the success count meets or exceeds the threshold\n        assert success_count >= threshold, f\"Replicas were not ready for at least 90% of the time. Success count: {success_count}, Required: {threshold}\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test carts-db replicas readiness threshold.')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=60, help='Duration to check the state in seconds')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    test = TestCartsDBReplicas()\n    test.test_replicas_ready_threshold(args.duration)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\n```2nd steady states:\n- Name: front-end-replica-running\n- Description: The next issue to address is the 'Single Replica Deployment' in the 'front-end' Deployment. This is a critical issue because having only a single replica can lead to downtime if the pod fails. The steady state for this manifest should ensure that the 'front-end' pod is running and available, which can be measured by checking the number of replicas that are in the 'Running' state. Since there is only one replica, the steady state should ensure that this single replica is running and ready for the entire duration of the monitoring period.\n- Threshold for the steady state: The 'front-end' pod must have at least 1 running and ready replica for 95% of the time within a 1-minute monitoring period.; The steady state we are considering is the availability of the 'front-end' pod, which currently has a single replica. The current state shows that the single replica is consistently running and ready, as indicated by the repeated output of 'Running and ready front-end pods: 1'. Given that the system is expected to maintain this state, the threshold should ensure that the single replica remains running and ready for the entire duration of the monitoring period. Since the monitoring period in the script is 5 seconds, and the Chaos Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute, we can set a threshold that requires the front-end pod to be running and ready for at least 95% of the time during a 1-minute period. This accounts for any minor fluctuations or delays in pod readiness checks.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestFrontEndReplicaRunning(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.namespace = 'sock-shop'\n        self.deployment_name = 'front-end'\n\n    def check_front_end_status(self):\n        # List all pods in the specified namespace with the label 'name=front-end'\n        pods = self.v1.list_namespaced_pod(namespace=self.namespace, label_selector=f'name={self.deployment_name}').items\n        # Filter pods that are in the 'Running' state\n        running_pods = [pod for pod in pods if pod.status.phase == 'Running']\n        # Further filter pods that are ready\n        ready_pods = [pod for pod in running_pods if all(container.ready for container in pod.status.container_statuses)]\n        return len(ready_pods)\n\n    def test_steady_state(self, duration):\n        successful_checks = 0\n        total_checks = duration\n\n        for _ in range(duration):\n            running_and_ready = self.check_front_end_status()\n            print(f'Running and ready front-end pods: {running_and_ready}')\n            if running_and_ready >= 1:\n                successful_checks += 1\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the percentage of successful checks\n        success_rate = (successful_checks / total_checks) * 100\n        print(f'Success rate: {success_rate}%')\n\n        # Assert that the success rate is at least 95%\n        assert success_rate >= 95, f'Success rate {success_rate}% is below the threshold of 95%'\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test front-end pod steady state.')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=60, help='Duration to check the status in seconds')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    test = TestFrontEndReplicaRunning()\n    test.test_steady_state(args.duration)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\n```\n\n# A fault scenario that may occur in my system and may affect the steady states:\n\nAn assumed fault scenario is as follows:\n- Event: Black Friday Sale\n- Used Chaos Engineering tool: Chaos Mesh\n- Faults to simulate the event: [[Fault(name='StressChaos', name_id=0, params={'mode': 'all', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['sock-shop'], 'labelSelectors': {'name': 'carts-db'}}, 'stressors': {'cpu': {'workers': 2, 'load': 80}, 'memory': {'workers': 2, 'size': '256MB'}}, 'containerNames': ['carts-db']})], [Fault(name='PodChaos', name_id=0, params={'action': 'pod-kill', 'mode': 'one', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['sock-shop'], 'labelSelectors': {'name': 'front-end'}}, 'value': '1'})]]\n- Description: During a Black Friday sale, the system is expected to handle a significant increase in traffic and load. This event will test the system's ability to maintain steady states under high demand. The 'carts-db' and 'front-end' components are critical to the user experience, as they handle shopping cart operations and the user interface, respectively. The 'carts-db' deployment lacks resource requests, which could lead to scheduling issues under resource constraints. The 'front-end' deployment has a single replica, making it vulnerable to downtime if the pod fails. To simulate the Black Friday event, we will first inject a StressChaos fault to increase CPU and memory usage on the 'carts-db' pods, testing their ability to remain running without resource requests. Next, we will inject a PodChaos fault to kill the 'front-end' pod, testing the system's ability to recover and maintain availability with a single replica. This sequence of fault injections will reveal potential weaknesses in resource allocation and redundancy, ensuring the system can handle the increased load and maintain steady states.\n\n# Please follow the instructions below regarding Chaos Engineering as necessary:\n- The Chaos-Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute.\n- When using k6 in steady-state definition, always select a request URL from the specified options.\n\nNow, please detail the post-validation phase.

            "{\"thought\":\"In the post-validation phase, we need to ensure that the system has returned to its steady states after the fault injection. Given the faults injected during the Black Friday Sale simulation, we will focus on verifying the steady states of the 'carts-db' and 'front-end' components. The post-validation phase is 20 seconds long, so we need to efficiently schedule the unit tests to verify the steady states within this time frame. \\n\\nThe approach is to run the unit tests for both steady states simultaneously, as they are independent checks and can be executed in parallel. This allows us to maximize the use of the available time and ensure both components are back to their expected states. The 'carts-db-replicas-running' test will check if the 'carts-db' replicas are running and ready for at least 90% of the time during the 20-second period, while the 'front-end-replica-running' test will verify that the 'front-end' pod is running and ready for at least 95% of the time. \\n\\nBy running these tests concurrently, we can quickly determine if the system has recovered from the faults and returned to its steady states, ensuring that the system is resilient and can handle similar scenarios in the future.\",\"unit_tests\":[{\"name\":\"carts-db-replicas-running\",\"grace_period\":\"0s\",\"duration\":\"20s\"},{\"name\":\"front-end-replica-running\",\"grace_period\":\"0s\",\"duration\":\"20s\"}]}\n",

The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"summary\": {\"title\": \"Summary\", \"description\": \"The summary of the given Chaos-Engineering-experiment plan.\", \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"required\": [\"summary\"]}\n```\n\nHuman: # Here is my Chaos-Engineering-experiment plan:\n## Time Schedule\nThe Chaos Engineering experiment is designed to test the system's resilience under simulated fault conditions, specifically during a high-demand event like a Black Friday sale. The experiment must be completed within 1 minute, so careful time allocation is crucial. The experiment is divided into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation. \n\n1. **Pre-validation Phase (20 seconds):** This phase ensures that the system is in a steady state before any faults are injected. We will verify that the 'carts-db' replicas are running and ready for at least 90% of the time, and the 'front-end' replica is running and ready for at least 95% of the time. Given the short duration of the experiment, a 20-second pre-validation period is sufficient to confirm the system's initial stability.\n\n2. **Fault Injection Phase (20 seconds):** During this phase, we will inject the specified faults using Chaos Mesh. The 'carts-db' will undergo a StressChaos fault to simulate high CPU and memory usage, while the 'front-end' will experience a PodChaos fault to simulate a pod failure. The 20-second duration allows us to observe the system's behavior under stress and its ability to maintain steady states.\n\n3. **Post-validation Phase (20 seconds):** After fault injection, we need to ensure that the system returns to its steady states. This phase will verify that the 'carts-db' replicas and the 'front-end' replica meet their respective thresholds for readiness and availability. A 20-second post-validation period is adequate to confirm recovery and stability.\n\nThe total time for the experiment is 60 seconds, with each phase allocated 20 seconds to balance validation and fault observation effectively.\n\n## Pre-validation Phase\nIn the pre-validation phase, we need to ensure that the system is in its expected steady state before we proceed with fault injection. This involves verifying that the critical components, 'carts-db' and 'front-end', are operating as expected. Given the constraints of a 20-second total time for this phase, we will execute the unit tests for both steady states simultaneously to maximize efficiency. The 'carts-db-replicas-running' test will check that the 'carts-db' replicas are running and ready for at least 90% of the time during a 10-second monitoring period. Similarly, the 'front-end-replica-running' test will verify that the 'front-end' pod is running and ready for at least 95% of the time during the same 10-second period. By running these tests concurrently, we ensure that both components are in their expected steady states within the limited time frame, allowing us to proceed confidently to the fault injection phase.\n- Verified Steady State #0: ```carts-db-replicas-running```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```pre-unittest-carts-db-replicas-running```  \n  - Grace Period: ```0s```  \n  - Duration: ```10s```  \n- Verified Steady State #1: ```front-end-replica-running```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```pre-unittest-front-end-replica-running```  \n  - Grace Period: ```0s```  \n  - Duration: ```10s```  \n\n\n## Fault-injection Phase \nIn this fault-injection phase, we aim to simulate a Black Friday sale scenario by injecting two types of faults: StressChaos on the 'carts-db' pods and PodChaos on the 'front-end' pod. The total duration for this phase is 20 seconds, so we need to carefully time the injections to observe their effects on the system's steady states. \n\nFirst, we will inject the StressChaos fault on the 'carts-db' pods. This fault will increase CPU and memory usage, testing the pods' ability to handle high load without resource requests. We will start this fault at the beginning of the phase (grace period of 0s) and let it run for 10 seconds. This duration is chosen to allow enough time for the stress to impact the system while leaving time for the next fault.\n\nNext, we will inject the PodChaos fault on the 'front-end' pod. This fault will kill the pod, testing the system's ability to recover and maintain availability with a single replica. We will start this fault 10 seconds into the phase (grace period of 10s) and let it run for the remaining 10 seconds. This staggered approach allows us to observe the effects of each fault separately and ensures that the system is under stress for the entire duration of the phase.\n\nBy staggering the faults, we can better understand how each component reacts to stress and failure, providing insights into potential weaknesses in resource allocation and redundancy.\n\n\n- Injected Faults #0: ```StressChaos```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```fault-stresschaos```  \n  - Grace Period: ```0s```  \n  - Duration: ```10s```  \n- Injected Faults #1: ```PodChaos```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```fault-podchaos```  \n  - Grace Period: ```10s```  \n  - Duration: ```10s```  \n\n\n## Post-validation phase\nIn the post-validation phase, we need to ensure that the system has returned to its steady states after the fault injection. Given the faults injected during the Black Friday Sale simulation, we will focus on verifying the steady states of the 'carts-db' and 'front-end' components. The post-validation phase is 20 seconds long, so we need to efficiently schedule the unit tests to verify the steady states within this time frame. \n\nThe approach is to run the unit tests for both steady states simultaneously, as they are independent checks and can be executed in parallel. This allows us to maximize the use of the available time and ensure both components are back to their expected states. The 'carts-db-replicas-running' test will check if the 'carts-db' replicas are running and ready for at least 90% of the time during the 20-second period, while the 'front-end-replica-running' test will verify that the 'front-end' pod is running and ready for at least 95% of the time. \n\nBy running these tests concurrently, we can quickly determine if the system has recovered from the faults and returned to its steady states, ensuring that the system is resilient and can handle similar scenarios in the future.\n- Verified Steady State #0: ```carts-db-replicas-running```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```post-unittest-carts-db-replicas-running```  \n  - Grace Period: ```0s```  \n  - Duration: ```20s```  \n- Verified Steady State #1: ```front-end-replica-running```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```post-unittest-front-end-replica-running```  \n  - Grace Period: ```0s```  \n  - Duration: ```20s```  \n\n\nPlease summarize the above plan.\n\nAI: ```json\n{\"summary\":"

            "{\"summary\": \"The Chaos Engineering experiment is structured into three phases, each lasting 20 seconds, to test the system's resilience during a simulated high-demand event. In the pre-validation phase, which lasts for 20 seconds, two unit tests are executed simultaneously to ensure the system is in a steady state before fault injection. The 'carts-db-replicas-running' test, with a workflow name of 'pre-unittest-carts-db-replicas-running', and the 'front-end-replica-running' test, with a workflow name of 'pre-unittest-front-end-replica-running', both start immediately at the beginning of the phase and run for 10 seconds. This concurrent execution confirms the readiness of the 'carts-db' replicas and the 'front-end' pod. In the fault-injection phase, also 20 seconds long, two faults are injected in a staggered manner. The 'StressChaos' fault, with a workflow name of 'fault-stresschaos', is injected at the start of the phase and runs for 10 seconds, simulating high CPU and memory usage on the 'carts-db' pods. Following this, the 'PodChaos' fault, with a workflow name of 'fault-podchaos', is injected 10 seconds into the phase and runs for the remaining 10 seconds, simulating a pod failure on the 'front-end'. This staggered approach allows for separate observation of each fault's impact. Finally, in the post-validation phase, which is again 20 seconds long, the system's recovery is verified by running two unit tests concurrently. The 'carts-db-replicas-running' test, with a workflow name of 'post-unittest-carts-db-replicas-running', and the 'front-end-replica-running' test, with a workflow name of 'post-unittest-front-end-replica-running', both start immediately and run for the full 20 seconds. This ensures that both the 'carts-db' replicas and the 'front-end' pod have returned to their expected steady states, confirming the system's resilience and recovery capabilities.\"}"
