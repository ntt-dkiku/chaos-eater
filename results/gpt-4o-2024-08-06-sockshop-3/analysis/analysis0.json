    "report": "The Chaos Engineering experiment aimed to test the resilience of the 'sock-shop' system under simulated high-demand conditions, specifically focusing on the 'carts-db' and 'front-end' components. The experiment was structured into three phases: pre-validation, fault injection, and post-validation. The results indicate that while the 'carts-db' component maintained its steady state throughout the experiment, the 'front-end' component failed to meet its steady state threshold during the post-validation phase.\n\n1. **Pre-Validation Phase:**\n   - Both the 'carts-db-replicas-running' and 'front-end-replica-running' tests passed, indicating that the system was in a steady state before the fault injection. This confirms that the initial conditions were correctly set, with the 'carts-db' replicas running and the single 'front-end' pod operational.\n\n2. **Fault Injection Phase:**\n   - The 'StressChaos' fault was injected first, targeting the 'carts-db' pods with increased CPU and memory usage. Despite the lack of resource requests in the 'carts-db' deployment, the system managed to maintain the steady state for 'carts-db', as evidenced by the successful post-validation test.\n   - The 'PodChaos' fault was injected next, targeting the 'front-end' pod by simulating a pod failure. This fault exposed a critical vulnerability in the system: the single replica configuration of the 'front-end' deployment.\n\n3. **Post-Validation Phase:**\n   - The 'carts-db-replicas-running' test passed, confirming that the 'carts-db' component recovered successfully from the stress conditions.\n   - The 'front-end-replica-running' test failed, with a success rate of only 10%, far below the required 95% threshold. The logs indicate that the 'front-end' pod was not running and ready for the majority of the post-validation period. This failure is directly linked to the single replica configuration of the 'front-end' deployment, which lacks redundancy. When the 'PodChaos' fault killed the 'front-end' pod, there was no additional replica to take over, leading to downtime.\n\n**Insights and Recommendations:**\n- The failure of the 'front-end' component highlights the critical issue of having a single replica deployment. To improve resilience, it is recommended to increase the number of replicas for the 'front-end' deployment. This will provide redundancy and ensure that the system can maintain availability even if one pod fails.\n- Consider implementing horizontal pod autoscaling for the 'front-end' deployment to dynamically adjust the number of replicas based on traffic and load conditions.\n- Review and enhance the readiness and liveness probes for the 'front-end' deployment to ensure that Kubernetes can effectively manage pod health and recovery.\n- While the 'carts-db' component maintained its steady state, it is advisable to define resource requests to prevent potential scheduling issues under resource constraints in future scenarios.\n\nIn conclusion, the experiment successfully identified a significant resilience issue in the 'front-end' component, providing valuable insights for improving the system's fault tolerance and availability."
