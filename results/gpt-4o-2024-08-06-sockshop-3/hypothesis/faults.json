    "description": "During a Black Friday sale, the system is expected to handle a significant increase in traffic and load. This event will test the system's ability to maintain steady states under high demand. The 'carts-db' and 'front-end' components are critical to the user experience, as they handle shopping cart operations and the user interface, respectively. The 'carts-db' deployment lacks resource requests, which could lead to scheduling issues under resource constraints. The 'front-end' deployment has a single replica, making it vulnerable to downtime if the pod fails. To simulate the Black Friday event, we will first inject a StressChaos fault to increase CPU and memory usage on the 'carts-db' pods, testing their ability to remain running without resource requests. Next, we will inject a PodChaos fault to kill the 'front-end' pod, testing the system's ability to recover and maintain availability with a single replica. This sequence of fault injections will reveal potential weaknesses in resource allocation and redundancy, ensuring the system can handle the increased load and maintain steady states."
