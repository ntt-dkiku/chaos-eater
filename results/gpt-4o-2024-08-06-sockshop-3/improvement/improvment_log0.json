It provides functionalities such as browsing a catalogue, managing a shopping cart, placing orders, processing payments, handling shipping, and managing user accounts.; The manifests provided are part of a well-known microservices demo application called 'Sock Shop'. This application is designed to demonstrate the use of microservices architecture and Kubernetes. The application simulates an e-commerce website for selling socks, and the manifests include various components such as front-end, back-end services, databases, and messaging systems. The naming conventions, such as 'carts', 'catalogue', 'orders', 'payment', 'shipping', and 'user', align with typical e-commerce functionalities. Additionally, the use of images from 'weaveworksdemos' further indicates that this is the Sock Shop demo application.\n\n# Here is the hypothesis for my system:\nThe hypothesis is \"The steady states of the sytem are maintained even when the fault scenario occurs (i.e., when the faults are injected)\".\nThe steady states here are as follows:\n2 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: carts-db-replicas-running\n- Description: The first issue to address is the 'Missing Resource Requests' in the 'carts-db' Deployment. This is a critical issue because without resource requests, the pods may not be scheduled if the cluster is under resource constraints, leading to potential downtime. The steady state for this manifest should ensure that the 'carts-db' pods are running and available, which can be measured by checking the number of replicas that are in the 'Running' state.\n- Threshold for the steady state: The 'carts-db' replicas must be ready for at least 90% of the time during a 1-minute monitoring period, which equates to at least 54 out of 60 seconds.; The steady state we are considering is the number of 'carts-db' replicas that are running and ready. The current state shows that there are 2 replicas, and both are ready, which is the expected state. Given that the deployment specifies 2 replicas, the threshold should ensure that both replicas are running and ready. To account for some fluctuations and ensure the system remains stable, we can define a threshold that allows for a small percentage of time where not all replicas are ready, as long as the system recovers quickly. Since the experiment duration is 1 minute, we can set a threshold that requires the 'carts-db' replicas to be ready for at least 90% of the time during this period. This means that out of 60 seconds, the replicas should be ready for at least 54 seconds. This threshold provides a reasonable tolerance for transient issues while ensuring the system remains stable.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestCartsDBReplicas(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.v1_apps = client.AppsV1Api()\n\n    def check_carts_db_replicas(self, namespace='sock-shop', deployment_name='carts-db'):\n        try:\n            deployment = self.v1_apps.read_namespaced_deployment(name=deployment_name, namespace=namespace)\n            replicas = deployment.status.replicas\n            ready_replicas = deployment.status.ready_replicas\n            print(f\"Total replicas: {replicas}, Ready replicas: {ready_replicas}\")\n            return ready_replicas == replicas\n        except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n            print(f\"Exception when calling AppsV1Api->read_namespaced_deployment: {e}\")\n            return False\n\n    def test_replicas_ready_threshold(self, duration):\n        success_count = 0\n        for _ in range(duration):\n            if self.check_carts_db_replicas():\n                success_count += 1\n            time.sleep(1)\n        # Calculate the threshold as 90% of the duration\n        threshold = 0.9 * duration\n        print(f\"Carts-db replicas running successfully for {success_count}/{duration} seconds.\")\n        # Assert that the success count meets or exceeds the threshold\n        assert success_count >= threshold, f\"Replicas were not ready for at least 90% of the time. Success count: {success_count}, Required: {threshold}\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test carts-db replicas readiness threshold.')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=60, help='Duration to check the state in seconds')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    test = TestCartsDBReplicas()\n    test.test_replicas_ready_threshold(args.duration)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\n```2nd steady states:\n- Name: front-end-replica-running\n- Description: The next issue to address is the 'Single Replica Deployment' in the 'front-end' Deployment. This is a critical issue because having only a single replica can lead to downtime if the pod fails. The steady state for this manifest should ensure that the 'front-end' pod is running and available, which can be measured by checking the number of replicas that are in the 'Running' state. Since there is only one replica, the steady state should ensure that this single replica is running and ready for the entire duration of the monitoring period.\n- Threshold for the steady state: The 'front-end' pod must have at least 1 running and ready replica for 95% of the time within a 1-minute monitoring period.; The steady state we are considering is the availability of the 'front-end' pod, which currently has a single replica. The current state shows that the single replica is consistently running and ready, as indicated by the repeated output of 'Running and ready front-end pods: 1'. Given that the system is expected to maintain this state, the threshold should ensure that the single replica remains running and ready for the entire duration of the monitoring period. Since the monitoring period in the script is 5 seconds, and the Chaos Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute, we can set a threshold that requires the front-end pod to be running and ready for at least 95% of the time during a 1-minute period. This accounts for any minor fluctuations or delays in pod readiness checks.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestFrontEndReplicaRunning(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.namespace = 'sock-shop'\n        self.deployment_name = 'front-end'\n\n    def check_front_end_status(self):\n        # List all pods in the specified namespace with the label 'name=front-end'\n        pods = self.v1.list_namespaced_pod(namespace=self.namespace, label_selector=f'name={self.deployment_name}').items\n        # Filter pods that are in the 'Running' state\n        running_pods = [pod for pod in pods if pod.status.phase == 'Running']\n        # Further filter pods that are ready\n        ready_pods = [pod for pod in running_pods if all(container.ready for container in pod.status.container_statuses)]\n        return len(ready_pods)\n\n    def test_steady_state(self, duration):\n        successful_checks = 0\n        total_checks = duration\n\n        for _ in range(duration):\n            running_and_ready = self.check_front_end_status()\n            print(f'Running and ready front-end pods: {running_and_ready}')\n            if running_and_ready >= 1:\n                successful_checks += 1\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the percentage of successful checks\n        success_rate = (successful_checks / total_checks) * 100\n        print(f'Success rate: {success_rate}%')\n\n        # Assert that the success rate is at least 95%\n        assert success_rate >= 95, f'Success rate {success_rate}% is below the threshold of 95%'\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test front-end pod steady state.')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=60, help='Duration to check the status in seconds')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    test = TestFrontEndReplicaRunning()\n    test.test_steady_state(args.duration)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\n```\n\nThe fault scenario here is as follows:\n\nAn assumed fault scenario is as follows:\n- Event: Black Friday Sale\n- Used Chaos Engineering tool: Chaos Mesh\n- Faults to simulate the event: [[Fault(name='StressChaos', name_id=0, params={'mode': 'all', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['sock-shop'], 'labelSelectors': {'name': 'carts-db'}}, 'stressors': {'cpu': {'workers': 2, 'load': 80}, 'memory': {'workers': 2, 'size': '256MB'}}, 'containerNames': ['carts-db']})], [Fault(name='PodChaos', name_id=0, params={'action': 'pod-kill', 'mode': 'one', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['sock-shop'], 'labelSelectors': {'name': 'front-end'}}, 'value': '1'})]]\n- Description: During a Black Friday sale, the system is expected to handle a significant increase in traffic and load. This event will test the system's ability to maintain steady states under high demand. The 'carts-db' and 'front-end' components are critical to the user experience, as they handle shopping cart operations and the user interface, respectively. The 'carts-db' deployment lacks resource requests, which could lead to scheduling issues under resource constraints. The 'front-end' deployment has a single replica, making it vulnerable to downtime if the pod fails. To simulate the Black Friday event, we will first inject a StressChaos fault to increase CPU and memory usage on the 'carts-db' pods, testing their ability to remain running without resource requests. Next, we will inject a PodChaos fault to kill the 'front-end' pod, testing the system's ability to recover and maintain availability with a single replica. This sequence of fault injections will reveal potential weaknesses in resource allocation and redundancy, ensuring the system can handle the increased load and maintain steady states.\n\n# Here is the overview of my Chaos-Engineering experiment to verify the hypothesis:\nThe Chaos Engineering experiment is structured into three phases, each lasting 20 seconds, to test the system's resilience during a simulated high-demand event. In the pre-validation phase, which lasts for 20 seconds, two unit tests are executed simultaneously to ensure the system is in a steady state before fault injection. The 'carts-db-replicas-running' test, with a workflow name of 'pre-unittest-carts-db-replicas-running', and the 'front-end-replica-running' test, with a workflow name of 'pre-unittest-front-end-replica-running', both start immediately at the beginning of the phase and run for 10 seconds. This concurrent execution confirms the readiness of the 'carts-db' replicas and the 'front-end' pod. In the fault-injection phase, also 20 seconds long, two faults are injected in a staggered manner. The 'StressChaos' fault, with a workflow name of 'fault-stresschaos', is injected at the start of the phase and runs for 10 seconds, simulating high CPU and memory usage on the 'carts-db' pods. Following this, the 'PodChaos' fault, with a workflow name of 'fault-podchaos', is injected 10 seconds into the phase and runs for the remaining 10 seconds, simulating a pod failure on the 'front-end'. This staggered approach allows for separate observation of each fault's impact. Finally, in the post-validation phase, which is again 20 seconds long, the system's recovery is verified by running two unit tests concurrently. The 'carts-db-replicas-running' test, with a workflow name of 'post-unittest-carts-db-replicas-running', and the 'front-end-replica-running' test, with a workflow name of 'post-unittest-front-end-replica-running', both start immediately and run for the full 20 seconds. This ensures that both the 'carts-db' replicas and the 'front-end' pod have returned to their expected steady states, confirming the system's resilience and recovery capabilities.\n\n# The experiment's results of the original system are as follows:\nPassed unittests:\n- pre-unittest-carts-db-replicas-running\n- pre-unittest-front-end-replica-running\n- post-unittest-carts-db-replicas-running\nFailed unittests:\n- post-unittest-front-end-replica-running\n```log\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/chaos-eater/sandbox/cycle_20241127_035323/hypothesis/unittest_front-end-replica-running_mod0.py\", line 51, in <module>\nRunning and ready front-end pods: 0\nRunning and ready front-end pods: 0\nRunning and ready front-end pods: 0\nRunning and ready front-end pods: 0\nRunning and ready front-end pods: 0\nRunning and ready front-end pods: 0\nRunning and ready front-end pods: 0\nRunning and ready front-end pods: 0\nRunning and ready front-end pods: 0\nRunning and...ds: 1\nSuccess rate: 10.0%\n    main()\n  File \"/chaos-eater/sandbox/cycle_20241127_035323/hypothesis/unittest_front-end-replica-running_mod0.py\", line 47, in main\n    test.test_steady_state(args.duration)\n  File \"/chaos-eater/sandbox/cycle_20241127_035323/hypothesis/unittest_front-end-replica-running_mod0.py\", line 38, in test_steady_state\n    assert success_rate >= 95, f'Success rate {success_rate}% is below the threshold of 95%'\nAssertionError: Success rate 10.0% is below the threshold of 95%\n\n```\n\n\nFirst, please analyze the results and provide an analysis report rich in insights.\nAI: # Here is my analysis report:\nThe Chaos Engineering experiment aimed to test the resilience of the 'sock-shop' system under simulated high-demand conditions, specifically focusing on the 'carts-db' and 'front-end' components. The experiment was structured into three phases: pre-validation, fault injection, and post-validation. The results indicate that while the 'carts-db' component maintained its steady state throughout the experiment, the 'front-end' component failed to meet its steady state threshold during the post-validation phase.\n\n1. **Pre-Validation Phase:**\n   - Both the 'carts-db-replicas-running' and 'front-end-replica-running' tests passed, indicating that the system was in a steady state before the fault injection. This confirms that the initial conditions were correctly set, with the 'carts-db' replicas running and the single 'front-end' pod operational.\n\n2. **Fault Injection Phase:**\n   - The 'StressChaos' fault was injected first, targeting the 'carts-db' pods with increased CPU and memory usage. Despite the lack of resource requests in the 'carts-db' deployment, the system managed to maintain the steady state for 'carts-db', as evidenced by the successful post-validation test.\n   - The 'PodChaos' fault was injected next, targeting the 'front-end' pod by simulating a pod failure. This fault exposed a critical vulnerability in the system: the single replica configuration of the 'front-end' deployment.\n\n3. **Post-Validation Phase:**\n   - The 'carts-db-replicas-running' test passed, confirming that the 'carts-db' component recovered successfully from the stress conditions.\n   - The 'front-end-replica-running' test failed, with a success rate of only 10%, far below the required 95% threshold. The logs indicate that the 'front-end' pod was not running and ready for the majority of the post-validation period. This failure is directly linked to the single replica configuration of the 'front-end' deployment, which lacks redundancy. When the 'PodChaos' fault killed the 'front-end' pod, there was no additional replica to take over, leading to downtime.\n\n**Insights and Recommendations:**\n- The failure of the 'front-end' component highlights the critical issue of having a single replica deployment. To improve resilience, it is recommended to increase the number of replicas for the 'front-end' deployment. This will provide redundancy and ensure that the system can maintain availability even if one pod fails.\n- Consider implementing horizontal pod autoscaling for the 'front-end' deployment to dynamically adjust the number of replicas based on traffic and load conditions.\n- Review and enhance the readiness and liveness probes for the 'front-end' deployment to ensure that Kubernetes can effectively manage pod health and recovery.\n- While the 'carts-db' component maintained its steady state, it is advisable to define resource requests to prevent potential scheduling issues under resource constraints in future scenarios.\n\nIn conclusion, the experiment successfully identified a significant resilience issue in the 'front-end' component, providing valuable insights for improving the system's fault tolerance and availability.\nHuman: Then, please reconfigure the system to avoid the fails (improve resiliency).\nAI: ```json\n{\"thought\":"
