                "System: You are a helpful AI assistant for Chaos Engineering.\nGiven K8s manifests for a system and user's instructions, you will define the system's steady states (i.e., normal behaviors) that are related to potential issues of the system.\nAlways keep the following rules:\n- Define steady states one by one, starting with the steady state related to the K8s resource that is easiest to encounter issues when certain failures occur.\n- Consider whether a new steady state needs to be added, and if so, add a steady state. If not, indicate the end of the steady-state addition with 'exits=True'.\n- Prioritize adding a steady state related to the issue that is easiest to occur to verify through Chaos Engineering whether it's truly a problem later.\n- An added steady state must be a measurable output, such as the number of pods, throughput, error rates, latency percentiles, etc.\n- An added steady state must be specific to a SINGLE K8s resource (i.e., manifest) having potential issues for resilency and redundancy.\n- An added steady state must be different from the already defined ones.\n- The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"thought\": {\"title\": \"Thought\", \"description\": \"Describe your thought process of determing the steady state of a SINGLE K8s resource (i.e., manifest) that is easiest to encounter the issues. Describe also the details of the steady state itself.\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"exits\": {\"title\": \"Exits\", \"description\": \"Whether to stop adding a new steady state or not. If you stop here, output 'true'. If you keep adding a new steady state, output 'false'.\", \"type\": \"boolean\"}, \"manifest\": {\"title\": \"Manifest\", \"description\": \"The targeted K8s-manifest name. Specify a SINGLE manifest.\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"name\": {\"title\": \"Name\", \"description\": \"Steady state name including the target K8s resource (manifest) name.

problematic config: The deployments for carts-db, catalogue-db, orders-db, rabbitmq, session-db, and user-db do not specify resource requests.\n\nIssue #1: Single Replica Deployment\n  - details: The front-end deployment has only one replica, which can lead to downtime if the pod fails.\n  - manifests having the issues: ['sock-shop-2/manifests/09-front-end-dep.yaml']\n  - problematic config: spec.replicas: 1\n\nIssue #2: Missing Liveness and Readiness Probes\n  - details: Without liveness and readiness probes, Kubernetes cannot determine the health of the containers, which may lead to serving traffic to unhealthy pods.\n  - manifests having the issues: ['sock-shop-2/manifests/01-carts-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/03-carts-db-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/05-catalogue-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/07-catalogue-db-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/11-orders-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/13-orders-db-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/15-payment-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/17-queue-master-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/19-rabbitmq-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/21-session-db-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/23-shipping-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/25-user-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/27-user-db-dep.yaml']\n  -

details: Hardcoded environment variables, such as passwords, can lead to security vulnerabilities.\n  - manifests having the issues: ['sock-shop-2/manifests/07-catalogue-db-dep.yaml']\n  - problematic config: env: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD is hardcoded with value: fake_password.\n\nThe expected type of application on the system (i.e., K8s manfests):\nSock Shop is an e-commerce application that simulates an online sock store. It offers users the ability to browse a catalogue of socks, add items to a cart, place orders, and manage user accounts. The application is composed of multiple microservices, each responsible for a specific function, such as managing the product catalogue, handling user sessions, processing payments, and managing orders.; The manifests provided are part of a well-known microservices demo application called 'Sock Shop'. This application is designed to demonstrate the use of microservices architecture and Kubernetes orchestration. The application simulates an e-commerce website for selling socks, with various services such as carts, catalogue, orders, payment, and user management. The file names, labels, and Docker images used in the manifests (e.g., 'weaveworksdemos') are indicative of the Sock Shop application, which is a common reference application in the Kubernetes community.\n\n# Please follow the instructions below regarding Chaos Engineering:\n- The Chaos-Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute.\n- When using k6 in steady-state definition, always select a request URL from the following options (other requests are invalid):\n  1. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/\n  2. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/catalogue?size=10\n  3. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/detail.html?id=<ID>\n  Replace <ID> with an available ID: [`03fef6ac-1896-4ce8-bd69-b798f85c6e0b`, `3395a43e-2d88-40de-b95f-e00e1502085b`, `510a0d7e-8e83-4193-b483-e27e09ddc34d`, `808a2de1-1aaa-4c25-a9b9-6612e8f29a38`, `819e1fbf-8b7e-4f6d-811f-693534916a8b`, `837ab141-399e-4c1f-9abc-bace40296bac`, `a0a4f044-b040-410d-8ead-4de0446aec7e`, `d3588630-ad8e-49df-bbd7-3167f7efb246`, `zzz4f044-b040-410d-8ead-4de0446aec7e`]\n  4. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/category/\n  5. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/category?tags=<TAG>\n  Replace <TAG> with an available tag: [`magic`, `action`, `blue`, `brown`, `black`, `sport`, `formal`, `red`, `green`, `skin`, `geek`]\n  6. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/basket.html\n\n# Steady states already defined are the following:\nNo steady states are defined for now.\n\nAfter considering whether a new steady state needs to be added, define a steady state that are different from the already defined steady states, if necessary.\nAI: ```json\n{\"thought\":"

If you use k6, consider not only appropriate test duration but also an appropriate number of virtual users in the load test.\n- Pay attention to namespace specification. If the namespace is specified in the manifest, it is deployed with the namespace. If not, it is deployed with the 'default' namespace.\n- When sending requests to a K8s resources, use their internal DNS names in the format: ```service-name.namespace.svc.cluster.local:port```. For the port setting, use the service port, not the targetPort or nodePort. Ensure that the port matches the service port defined in the manifest.\n- If other request formats are provided by the user, follow the user's format.\n- The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema.

details: Hardcoded environment variables, such as passwords, can lead to security vulnerabilities.\n  - manifests having the issues: ['sock-shop-2/manifests/07-catalogue-db-dep.yaml']\n  - problematic config: env: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD is hardcoded with value: fake_password.\n\nThe expected type of application on the system (i.e., K8s manfests):\nSock Shop is an e-commerce application that simulates an online sock store. It offers users the ability to browse a catalogue of socks, add items to a cart, place orders, and manage user accounts. The application is composed of multiple microservices, each responsible for a specific function, such as managing the product catalogue, handling user sessions, processing payments, and managing orders.; The manifests provided are part of a well-known microservices demo application called 'Sock Shop'. This application is designed to demonstrate the use of microservices architecture and Kubernetes orchestration. The application simulates an e-commerce website for selling socks, with various services such as carts, catalogue, orders, payment, and user management. The file names, labels, and Docker images used in the manifests (e.g., 'weaveworksdemos') are indicative of the Sock Shop application, which is a common reference application in the Kubernetes community.\n\n# You will determine a reasonable threshold for the following steady state of my system:\ncarts-db-replicas: The first issue to address is the 'Missing Resource Requests' for the 'carts-db' deployment.

It offers users the ability to browse a catalogue of socks, add items to a cart, place orders, and manage user accounts. The application is composed of multiple microservices, each responsible for a specific function, such as managing the product catalogue, handling user sessions, processing payments, and managing orders.; The manifests provided are part of a well-known microservices demo application called 'Sock Shop'. This application is designed to demonstrate the use of microservices architecture and Kubernetes orchestration. The application simulates an e-commerce website for selling socks, with various services such as carts, catalogue, orders, payment, and user management. The file names, labels, and Docker images used in the manifests (e.g., 'weaveworksdemos') are indicative of the Sock Shop application, which is a common reference application in the Kubernetes community.\n\n# Please follow the instructions below regarding Chaos Engineering:\n- The Chaos-Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute.\n- When using k6 in steady-state definition, always select a request URL from the following options (other requests are invalid):\n  1. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/\n  2. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/catalogue?size=10\n  3. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/detail.html?id=<ID>\n  Replace <ID> with an available ID: [`03fef6ac-1896-4ce8-bd69-b798f85c6e0b`, `3395a43e-2d88-40de-b95f-e00e1502085b`, `510a0d7e-8e83-4193-b483-e27e09ddc34d`, `808a2de1-1aaa-4c25-a9b9-6612e8f29a38`, `819e1fbf-8b7e-4f6d-811f-693534916a8b`, `837ab141-399e-4c1f-9abc-bace40296bac`, `a0a4f044-b040-410d-8ead-4de0446aec7e`, `d3588630-ad8e-49df-bbd7-3167f7efb246`, `zzz4f044-b040-410d-8ead-4de0446aec7e`]\n  4. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/category/\n  5. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/category?tags=<TAG>\n  Replace <TAG> with an available tag: [`magic`, `action`, `blue`, `brown`, `black`, `sport`, `formal`, `red`, `green`, `skin`, `geek`]\n  6. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/basket.html\n\n# Steady states already defined are the following:\n1 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: carts-db-replicas\n- Description: The first issue to address is the 'Missing Resource Requests' for the 'carts-db' deployment. This is a critical issue because without resource requests, the pods may not get scheduled if the cluster is under resource pressure, leading to potential downtime. To ensure the system's steady state, we need to verify that the 'carts-db' deployment maintains the expected number of replicas, which is 2, even under resource constraints. This can be measured by checking the number of running pods for the 'carts-db' deployment.\n- Threshold for the steady state: At least 1 ready replica 100% of the time and 2 ready replicas at least 80% of the time during the monitoring period.; The steady state we are considering is the number of replicas for the 'carts-db' deployment. The current state shows that there are 2 total replicas and 2 ready replicas consistently over a period of 5 seconds. This indicates that the system is currently stable with all replicas being ready. Given that the deployment is configured to have 2 replicas, the threshold should ensure that both replicas are ready to maintain the steady state. To account for some fluctuations, we can set a tolerance that allows for a brief period where not all replicas are ready, but the system should recover quickly. A reasonable threshold would be to have at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time and both replicas ready at least 80% of the time during the monitoring period. This ensures that the system remains operational even if one replica temporarily becomes unavailable.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestCartsDBReplicas(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self, namespace='sock-shop', deployment_name='carts-db', duration=5):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.namespace = namespace\n        self.deployment_name = deployment_name\n        self.duration = duration\n        # Use the correct API client for deployments\n        self.apps_v1 = client.AppsV1Api()\n\n    def test_replicas_threshold(self):\n        # Initialize counters for ready replicas\n        total_checks = 0\n        ready_replicas_count = 0\n        fully_ready_replicas_count = 0\n\n        for _ in range(self.duration):\n            try:\n                # Read the deployment status using the correct API client\n                deployment = self.apps_v1.read_namespaced_deployment(self.deployment_name, self.namespace)\n                replicas = deployment.status.replicas\n                ready_replicas = deployment.status.ready_replicas\n                print(f\"Total replicas: {replicas}, Ready replicas: {ready_replicas}\")\n\n                # Increment the total checks\n                total_checks += 1\n\n                # Check if at least 1 replica is ready\n                if ready_replicas >= 1:\n                    ready_replicas_count += 1\n\n                # Check if both replicas are ready\n                if ready_replicas == 2:\n                    fully_ready_replicas_count += 1\n\n            except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n                print(f\"Exception when calling AppsV1Api->read_namespaced_deployment: {e}\")\n\n            # Wait for 1 second before the next check\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the percentage of time conditions are met\n        one_ready_percentage = (ready_replicas_count / total_checks) * 100\n        two_ready_percentage = (fully_ready_replicas_count / total_checks) * 100\n\n        # Assert the threshold conditions\n        assert one_ready_percentage == 100, \"At least 1 ready replica was not available 100% of the time.\"\n        assert two_ready_percentage >= 80, \"2 ready replicas were not available at least 80% of the time.\"\n\n        print(\"Test passed: Steady state conditions are satisfied.\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test carts-db replicas threshold')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=5, help='Duration to check the replicas')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    # Create an instance of the test class with the specified duration\n    test = TestCartsDBReplicas(duration=args.duration)\n    # Run the test\n    test.test_replicas_threshold()\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\n```\n\nAfter considering whether a new steady state needs to be added, define a steady state that are different from the already defined steady states, if necessary.\nAI: ```json\n{\"thought\":"

                "System: You are a helpful AI assistant for Chaos Engineering.\nGiven Kubernetes (K8s) manifests for a network system and its state type, you will inspect the current value of the state type.\nAlways keep the following rules:\n- You can use either K8s API (Python) or k6 (Javascript) to inspect the state.\n- Use the K8s API for checking the current state of K8s resources\n- Use k6 for checking communication statuses/metrics, such as request sending, response time, latency, etc.\n- If you use K8s API, consider appropriate test duration. If you use k6, consider not only appropriate test duration but also an appropriate number of virtual users in the load test.\n- Pay attention to namespace specification. If the namespace is specified in the manifest, it is deployed with the namespace. If not, it is deployed with the 'default' namespace.\n- When sending requests to a K8s resources, use their internal DNS names in the format: ```service-name.namespace.svc.cluster.local:port```. For the port setting, use the service port, not the targetPort or nodePort. Ensure that the port matches the service port defined in the manifest.\n- If other request formats are provided by the user, follow the user's format.\n- The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"thought\": {\"title\": \"Thought\", \"description\": \"Describe your thoughts for the tool usage. e.g., the reason why you choose the tool and how to use.\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"tool_type\": {\"title\": \"Tool Type\", \"description\": \"Tool to inspect the steady state.

This is a critical issue because having only one replica can lead to downtime if the pod fails. To ensure the system's steady state, we need to verify that the 'front-end' deployment maintains at least one running pod at all times. This can be measured by checking the number of running pods for the 'front-end' deployment. Given that the deployment is configured to have only 1 replica, the threshold should ensure that this single replica is always ready to maintain the steady state. A reasonable threshold would be to have at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time during the monitoring period.

problematic config: The deployments for carts-db, catalogue-db, orders-db, rabbitmq, session-db, and user-db do not specify resource requests.\n\nIssue #1: Single Replica Deployment\n  - details: The front-end deployment has only one replica, which can lead to downtime if the pod fails.\n  - manifests having the issues: ['sock-shop-2/manifests/09-front-end-dep.yaml']\n  - problematic config: spec.replicas: 1\n\nIssue #2: Missing Liveness and Readiness Probes\n  - details: Without liveness and readiness probes, Kubernetes cannot determine the health of the containers, which may lead to serving traffic to unhealthy pods.\n  - manifests having the issues: ['sock-shop-2/manifests/01-carts-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/03-carts-db-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/05-catalogue-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/07-catalogue-db-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/11-orders-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/13-orders-db-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/15-payment-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/17-queue-master-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/19-rabbitmq-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/21-session-db-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/23-shipping-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/25-user-dep.yaml', 'sock-shop-2/manifests/27-user-db-dep.yaml']\n  - problematic config: The deployments for carts, carts-db, catalogue, catalogue-db, orders, orders-db, payment, queue-master, rabbitmq, session-db, shipping, user, and user-db do not have liveness or readiness probes configured.\n\nIssue #3: Hardcoded Environment Variables\n  - details: Hardcoded environment variables, such as passwords, can lead to security vulnerabilities.\n  - manifests having the issues: ['sock-shop-2/manifests/07-catalogue-db-dep.yaml']\n  - problematic config: env: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD is hardcoded with value: fake_password.\n\nThe expected type of application on the system (i.e., K8s manfests):\nSock Shop is an e-commerce application that simulates an online sock store. It offers users the ability to browse a catalogue of socks, add items to a cart, place orders, and manage user accounts. The application is composed of multiple microservices, each responsible for a specific function, such as managing the product catalogue, handling user sessions, processing payments, and managing orders.; The manifests provided are part of a well-known microservices demo application called 'Sock Shop'. This application is designed to demonstrate the use of microservices architecture and Kubernetes orchestration. The application simulates an e-commerce website for selling socks, with various services such as carts, catalogue, orders, payment, and user management. The file names, labels, and Docker images used in the manifests (e.g., 'weaveworksdemos') are indicative of the Sock Shop application, which is a common reference application in the Kubernetes community.\n\n# You will determine a reasonable threshold for the following steady state of my system:\nfront-end-replica: The next issue to address is the 'Single Replica Deployment' for the 'front-end' deployment. This is a critical issue because having only one replica can lead to downtime if the pod fails. To ensure the system's steady state, we need to verify that the 'front-end' deployment maintains at least one running pod at all times.

Given that the deployment is configured to have only 1 replica, the threshold should ensure that this single replica is always ready to maintain the steady state.

It offers users the ability to browse a catalogue of socks, add items to a cart, place orders, and manage user accounts. The application is composed of multiple microservices, each responsible for a specific function, such as managing the product catalogue, handling user sessions, processing payments, and managing orders.; The manifests provided are part of a well-known microservices demo application called 'Sock Shop'. This application is designed to demonstrate the use of microservices architecture and Kubernetes orchestration. The application simulates an e-commerce website for selling socks, with various services such as carts, catalogue, orders, payment, and user management. The file names, labels, and Docker images used in the manifests (e.g., 'weaveworksdemos') are indicative of the Sock Shop application, which is a common reference application in the Kubernetes community.\n\nSteady states of the network system defined by the manifests are the following:\n2 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: carts-db-replicas\n- Description: The first issue to address is the 'Missing Resource Requests' for the 'carts-db' deployment. This is a critical issue because without resource requests, the pods may not get scheduled if the cluster is under resource pressure, leading to potential downtime. To ensure the system's steady state, we need to verify that the 'carts-db' deployment maintains the expected number of replicas, which is 2, even under resource constraints. This can be measured by checking the number of running pods for the 'carts-db' deployment.\n- Threshold for the steady state: At least 1 ready replica 100% of the time and 2 ready replicas at least 80% of the time during the monitoring period.; The steady state we are considering is the number of replicas for the 'carts-db' deployment. The current state shows that there are 2 total replicas and 2 ready replicas consistently over a period of 5 seconds. This indicates that the system is currently stable with all replicas being ready. Given that the deployment is configured to have 2 replicas, the threshold should ensure that both replicas are ready to maintain the steady state. To account for some fluctuations, we can set a tolerance that allows for a brief period where not all replicas are ready, but the system should recover quickly. A reasonable threshold would be to have at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time and both replicas ready at least 80% of the time during the monitoring period. This ensures that the system remains operational even if one replica temporarily becomes unavailable.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestCartsDBReplicas(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self, namespace='sock-shop', deployment_name='carts-db', duration=5):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.namespace = namespace\n        self.deployment_name = deployment_name\n        self.duration = duration\n        # Use the correct API client for deployments\n        self.apps_v1 = client.AppsV1Api()\n\n    def test_replicas_threshold(self):\n        # Initialize counters for ready replicas\n        total_checks = 0\n        ready_replicas_count = 0\n        fully_ready_replicas_count = 0\n\n        for _ in range(self.duration):\n            try:\n                # Read the deployment status using the correct API client\n                deployment = self.apps_v1.read_namespaced_deployment(self.deployment_name, self.namespace)\n                replicas = deployment.status.replicas\n                ready_replicas = deployment.status.ready_replicas\n                print(f\"Total replicas: {replicas}, Ready replicas: {ready_replicas}\")\n\n                # Increment the total checks\n                total_checks += 1\n\n                # Check if at least 1 replica is ready\n                if ready_replicas >= 1:\n                    ready_replicas_count += 1\n\n                # Check if both replicas are ready\n                if ready_replicas == 2:\n                    fully_ready_replicas_count += 1\n\n            except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n                print(f\"Exception when calling AppsV1Api->read_namespaced_deployment: {e}\")\n\n            # Wait for 1 second before the next check\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the percentage of time conditions are met\n        one_ready_percentage = (ready_replicas_count / total_checks) * 100\n        two_ready_percentage = (fully_ready_replicas_count / total_checks) * 100\n\n        # Assert the threshold conditions\n        assert one_ready_percentage == 100, \"At least 1 ready replica was not available 100% of the time.\"\n        assert two_ready_percentage >= 80, \"2 ready replicas were not available at least 80% of the time.\"\n\n        print(\"Test passed: Steady state conditions are satisfied.\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test carts-db replicas threshold')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=5, help='Duration to check the replicas')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    # Create an instance of the test class with the specified duration\n    test = TestCartsDBReplicas(duration=args.duration)\n    # Run the test\n    test.test_replicas_threshold()\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\n```2nd steady states:\n- Name: front-end-replica\n- Description: The next issue to address is the 'Single Replica Deployment' for the 'front-end' deployment. This is a critical issue because having only one replica can lead to downtime if the pod fails. To ensure the system's steady state, we need to verify that the 'front-end' deployment maintains at least one running pod at all times. This can be measured by checking the number of running pods for the 'front-end' deployment. Given that the deployment is configured to have only 1 replica, the threshold should ensure that this single replica is always ready to maintain the steady state. A reasonable threshold would be to have at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time during the monitoring period. This ensures that the system remains operational even if there are temporary issues with the pod.\n- Threshold for the steady state: At least 1 ready replica must be present 100% of the time during the monitoring period.; The steady state we are considering is the availability of the 'front-end' deployment, which currently has only one replica. The current state shows that the 'front-end' deployment has 1 ready replica consistently over a monitoring period of 5 seconds. To ensure the system remains operational, the threshold should be set such that the 'front-end' deployment maintains at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time during the monitoring period. This accounts for the fact that there is only one replica, and any downtime would mean the service is unavailable. Given the current state satisfies this condition, the threshold should be set to ensure that at least 1 ready replica is present 100% of the time during the monitoring period.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestFrontEndReplica(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self, namespace, deployment_name, duration):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.namespace = namespace\n        self.deployment_name = deployment_name\n        self.duration = duration\n        # Use AppsV1Api to interact with deployments\n        self.apps_v1 = client.AppsV1Api()\n\n    def test_steady_state(self):\n        ready_replicas_count = 0\n\n        # Loop for the specified duration\n        for _ in range(self.duration):\n            # Get the deployment status\n            resp = self.apps_v1.read_namespaced_deployment_status(self.deployment_name, self.namespace)\n            ready_replicas = resp.status.ready_replicas or 0\n            print(f\"Ready replicas for {self.deployment_name}: {ready_replicas}\")\n\n            # Check if the number of ready replicas is at least 1\n            if ready_replicas >= 1:\n                ready_replicas_count += 1\n\n            # Wait for 1 second before the next check\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the percentage of time the deployment was ready\n        readiness_percentage = (ready_replicas_count / self.duration) * 100\n        print(f\"{self.deployment_name} was ready {ready_replicas_count}/{self.duration} times.\")\n\n        # Assert that the deployment was ready 100% of the time\n        assert readiness_percentage == 100, f\"{self.deployment_name} readiness was {readiness_percentage}%, expected 100%.\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test front-end replica readiness')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=5, help='Duration to check the replicas')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    # Create a test instance and run the test\n    test = TestFrontEndReplica('sock-shop', 'front-end', args.duration)\n    test.test_steady_state()\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\nPlease follow the instructions below regarding Chaos Engineering as necessary:\n- The Chaos-Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute.\n- When using k6 in steady-state definition, always select a request URL from the following options (other requests are invalid):\n  1. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/\n  2. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/catalogue?size=10\n  3. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/detail.html?id=<ID>\n  Replace <ID> with an available ID: [`03fef6ac-1896-4ce8-bd69-b798f85c6e0b`, `3395a43e-2d88-40de-b95f-e00e1502085b`, `510a0d7e-8e83-4193-b483-e27e09ddc34d`, `808a2de1-1aaa-4c25-a9b9-6612e8f29a38`, `819e1fbf-8b7e-4f6d-811f-693534916a8b`, `837ab141-399e-4c1f-9abc-bace40296bac`, `a0a4f044-b040-410d-8ead-4de0446aec7e`, `d3588630-ad8e-49df-bbd7-3167f7efb246`, `zzz4f044-b040-410d-8ead-4de0446aec7e`]\n  4. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/category/\n  5. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/category?tags=<TAG>\n  Replace <TAG> with an available tag: [`magic`, `action`, `blue`, `brown`, `black`, `sport`, `formal`, `red`, `green`, `skin`, `geek`]\n  6. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/basket.html\n\nNow, please define fault injections to reveal the system's vulnerabilities.\nAI: ```json\n{\"event\":"

It offers users the ability to browse a catalogue of socks, add items to a cart, place orders, and manage user accounts. The application is composed of multiple microservices, each responsible for a specific function, such as managing the product catalogue, handling user sessions, processing payments, and managing orders.; The manifests provided are part of a well-known microservices demo application called 'Sock Shop'. This application is designed to demonstrate the use of microservices architecture and Kubernetes orchestration. The application simulates an e-commerce website for selling socks, with various services such as carts, catalogue, orders, payment, and user management. The file names, labels, and Docker images used in the manifests (e.g., 'weaveworksdemos') are indicative of the Sock Shop application, which is a common reference application in the Kubernetes community.\n\nSteady states of my system:\n2 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: carts-db-replicas\n- Description: The first issue to address is the 'Missing Resource Requests' for the 'carts-db' deployment. This is a critical issue because without resource requests, the pods may not get scheduled if the cluster is under resource pressure, leading to potential downtime. To ensure the system's steady state, we need to verify that the 'carts-db' deployment maintains the expected number of replicas, which is 2, even under resource constraints. This can be measured by checking the number of running pods for the 'carts-db' deployment.\n- Threshold for the steady state: At least 1 ready replica 100% of the time and 2 ready replicas at least 80% of the time during the monitoring period.; The steady state we are considering is the number of replicas for the 'carts-db' deployment. The current state shows that there are 2 total replicas and 2 ready replicas consistently over a period of 5 seconds. This indicates that the system is currently stable with all replicas being ready. Given that the deployment is configured to have 2 replicas, the threshold should ensure that both replicas are ready to maintain the steady state. To account for some fluctuations, we can set a tolerance that allows for a brief period where not all replicas are ready, but the system should recover quickly. A reasonable threshold would be to have at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time and both replicas ready at least 80% of the time during the monitoring period. This ensures that the system remains operational even if one replica temporarily becomes unavailable.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestCartsDBReplicas(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self, namespace='sock-shop', deployment_name='carts-db', duration=5):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.namespace = namespace\n        self.deployment_name = deployment_name\n        self.duration = duration\n        # Use the correct API client for deployments\n        self.apps_v1 = client.AppsV1Api()\n\n    def test_replicas_threshold(self):\n        # Initialize counters for ready replicas\n        total_checks = 0\n        ready_replicas_count = 0\n        fully_ready_replicas_count = 0\n\n        for _ in range(self.duration):\n            try:\n                # Read the deployment status using the correct API client\n                deployment = self.apps_v1.read_namespaced_deployment(self.deployment_name, self.namespace)\n                replicas = deployment.status.replicas\n                ready_replicas = deployment.status.ready_replicas\n                print(f\"Total replicas: {replicas}, Ready replicas: {ready_replicas}\")\n\n                # Increment the total checks\n                total_checks += 1\n\n                # Check if at least 1 replica is ready\n                if ready_replicas >= 1:\n                    ready_replicas_count += 1\n\n                # Check if both replicas are ready\n                if ready_replicas == 2:\n                    fully_ready_replicas_count += 1\n\n            except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n                print(f\"Exception when calling AppsV1Api->read_namespaced_deployment: {e}\")\n\n            # Wait for 1 second before the next check\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the percentage of time conditions are met\n        one_ready_percentage = (ready_replicas_count / total_checks) * 100\n        two_ready_percentage = (fully_ready_replicas_count / total_checks) * 100\n\n        # Assert the threshold conditions\n        assert one_ready_percentage == 100, \"At least 1 ready replica was not available 100% of the time.\"\n        assert two_ready_percentage >= 80, \"2 ready replicas were not available at least 80% of the time.\"\n\n        print(\"Test passed: Steady state conditions are satisfied.\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test carts-db replicas threshold')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=5, help='Duration to check the replicas')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    # Create an instance of the test class with the specified duration\n    test = TestCartsDBReplicas(duration=args.duration)\n    # Run the test\n    test.test_replicas_threshold()\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\n```2nd steady states:\n- Name: front-end-replica\n- Description: The next issue to address is the 'Single Replica Deployment' for the 'front-end' deployment. This is a critical issue because having only one replica can lead to downtime if the pod fails. To ensure the system's steady state, we need to verify that the 'front-end' deployment maintains at least one running pod at all times. This can be measured by checking the number of running pods for the 'front-end' deployment. Given that the deployment is configured to have only 1 replica, the threshold should ensure that this single replica is always ready to maintain the steady state. A reasonable threshold would be to have at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time during the monitoring period. This ensures that the system remains operational even if there are temporary issues with the pod.\n- Threshold for the steady state: At least 1 ready replica must be present 100% of the time during the monitoring period.; The steady state we are considering is the availability of the 'front-end' deployment, which currently has only one replica. The current state shows that the 'front-end' deployment has 1 ready replica consistently over a monitoring period of 5 seconds. To ensure the system remains operational, the threshold should be set such that the 'front-end' deployment maintains at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time during the monitoring period. This accounts for the fact that there is only one replica, and any downtime would mean the service is unavailable. Given the current state satisfies this condition, the threshold should be set to ensure that at least 1 ready replica is present 100% of the time during the monitoring period.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestFrontEndReplica(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self, namespace, deployment_name, duration):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.namespace = namespace\n        self.deployment_name = deployment_name\n        self.duration = duration\n        # Use AppsV1Api to interact with deployments\n        self.apps_v1 = client.AppsV1Api()\n\n    def test_steady_state(self):\n        ready_replicas_count = 0\n\n        # Loop for the specified duration\n        for _ in range(self.duration):\n            # Get the deployment status\n            resp = self.apps_v1.read_namespaced_deployment_status(self.deployment_name, self.namespace)\n            ready_replicas = resp.status.ready_replicas or 0\n            print(f\"Ready replicas for {self.deployment_name}: {ready_replicas}\")\n\n            # Check if the number of ready replicas is at least 1\n            if ready_replicas >= 1:\n                ready_replicas_count += 1\n\n            # Wait for 1 second before the next check\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the percentage of time the deployment was ready\n        readiness_percentage = (ready_replicas_count / self.duration) * 100\n        print(f\"{self.deployment_name} was ready {ready_replicas_count}/{self.duration} times.\")\n\n        # Assert that the deployment was ready 100% of the time\n        assert readiness_percentage == 100, f\"{self.deployment_name} readiness was {readiness_percentage}%, expected 100%.\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test front-end replica readiness')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=5, help='Duration to check the replicas')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    # Create a test instance and run the test\n    test = TestFrontEndReplica('sock-shop', 'front-end', args.duration)\n    test.test_steady_state()\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\nA fault scenario that may occur in my system and may affect the steady states:\n\nAn assumed fault scenario is as follows:\n- Event: Black Friday Sale\n- Used Chaos Engineering tool: Chaos Mesh\n- Faults to simulate the event: [[{'name': 'StressChaos', 'name_id': 0, 'scope': {'namespace': 'sock-shop', 'label': 'name=carts-db'}}], [{'name': 'PodChaos', 'name_id': 0, 'scope': {'namespace': 'sock-shop', 'label': 'name=front-end'}}]]\n- Description: During a Black Friday sale, the system is expected to handle a significant increase in traffic, which can stress the system's resources and reveal weaknesses. The 'carts-db' deployment lacks resource requests, which can lead to scheduling issues under resource pressure. The 'front-end' deployment has only one replica, making it a single point of failure. To simulate the Black Friday event, we will first inject a 'StressChaos' fault to simulate high CPU usage on the 'carts-db' pods, testing if the system can maintain the steady state of having at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time and 2 ready replicas 80% of the time. Next, we will inject a 'PodChaos' fault to kill the 'front-end' pod, testing if the system can maintain the steady state of having at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time. This sequence simulates the increased load and potential failures during a high-traffic event like Black Friday.\n\nPlease follow the instructions below regarding Chaos Engineering as necessary:\n- The Chaos-Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute.\n- When using k6 in steady-state definition, always select a request URL from the following options (other requests are invalid):\n  1. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/\n  2. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/catalogue?size=10\n  3. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/detail.html?id=<ID>\n  Replace <ID> with an available ID: [`03fef6ac-1896-4ce8-bd69-b798f85c6e0b`, `3395a43e-2d88-40de-b95f-e00e1502085b`, `510a0d7e-8e83-4193-b483-e27e09ddc34d`, `808a2de1-1aaa-4c25-a9b9-6612e8f29a38`, `819e1fbf-8b7e-4f6d-811f-693534916a8b`, `837ab141-399e-4c1f-9abc-bace40296bac`, `a0a4f044-b040-410d-8ead-4de0446aec7e`, `d3588630-ad8e-49df-bbd7-3167f7efb246`, `zzz4f044-b040-410d-8ead-4de0446aec7e`]\n  4. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/category/\n  5. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/category?tags=<TAG>\n  Replace <TAG> with an available tag: [`magic`, `action`, `blue`, `brown`, `black`, `sport`, `formal`, `red`, `green`, `skin`, `geek`]\n  6. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/basket.html\n\nNow, please detail the parameters of the fault \"StressChaos({'namespace': 'sock-shop', 'label': 'name=carts-db'})\".\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema.

It offers users the ability to browse a catalogue of socks, add items to a cart, place orders, and manage user accounts. The application is composed of multiple microservices, each responsible for a specific function, such as managing the product catalogue, handling user sessions, processing payments, and managing orders.; The manifests provided are part of a well-known microservices demo application called 'Sock Shop'. This application is designed to demonstrate the use of microservices architecture and Kubernetes orchestration. The application simulates an e-commerce website for selling socks, with various services such as carts, catalogue, orders, payment, and user management. The file names, labels, and Docker images used in the manifests (e.g., 'weaveworksdemos') are indicative of the Sock Shop application, which is a common reference application in the Kubernetes community.\n\nSteady states of my system:\n2 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: carts-db-replicas\n- Description: The first issue to address is the 'Missing Resource Requests' for the 'carts-db' deployment. This is a critical issue because without resource requests, the pods may not get scheduled if the cluster is under resource pressure, leading to potential downtime. To ensure the system's steady state, we need to verify that the 'carts-db' deployment maintains the expected number of replicas, which is 2, even under resource constraints. This can be measured by checking the number of running pods for the 'carts-db' deployment.\n- Threshold for the steady state: At least 1 ready replica 100% of the time and 2 ready replicas at least 80% of the time during the monitoring period.; The steady state we are considering is the number of replicas for the 'carts-db' deployment. The current state shows that there are 2 total replicas and 2 ready replicas consistently over a period of 5 seconds. This indicates that the system is currently stable with all replicas being ready. Given that the deployment is configured to have 2 replicas, the threshold should ensure that both replicas are ready to maintain the steady state. To account for some fluctuations, we can set a tolerance that allows for a brief period where not all replicas are ready, but the system should recover quickly. A reasonable threshold would be to have at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time and both replicas ready at least 80% of the time during the monitoring period. This ensures that the system remains operational even if one replica temporarily becomes unavailable.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestCartsDBReplicas(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self, namespace='sock-shop', deployment_name='carts-db', duration=5):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.namespace = namespace\n        self.deployment_name = deployment_name\n        self.duration = duration\n        # Use the correct API client for deployments\n        self.apps_v1 = client.AppsV1Api()\n\n    def test_replicas_threshold(self):\n        # Initialize counters for ready replicas\n        total_checks = 0\n        ready_replicas_count = 0\n        fully_ready_replicas_count = 0\n\n        for _ in range(self.duration):\n            try:\n                # Read the deployment status using the correct API client\n                deployment = self.apps_v1.read_namespaced_deployment(self.deployment_name, self.namespace)\n                replicas = deployment.status.replicas\n                ready_replicas = deployment.status.ready_replicas\n                print(f\"Total replicas: {replicas}, Ready replicas: {ready_replicas}\")\n\n                # Increment the total checks\n                total_checks += 1\n\n                # Check if at least 1 replica is ready\n                if ready_replicas >= 1:\n                    ready_replicas_count += 1\n\n                # Check if both replicas are ready\n                if ready_replicas == 2:\n                    fully_ready_replicas_count += 1\n\n            except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n                print(f\"Exception when calling AppsV1Api->read_namespaced_deployment: {e}\")\n\n            # Wait for 1 second before the next check\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the percentage of time conditions are met\n        one_ready_percentage = (ready_replicas_count / total_checks) * 100\n        two_ready_percentage = (fully_ready_replicas_count / total_checks) * 100\n\n        # Assert the threshold conditions\n        assert one_ready_percentage == 100, \"At least 1 ready replica was not available 100% of the time.\"\n        assert two_ready_percentage >= 80, \"2 ready replicas were not available at least 80% of the time.\"\n\n        print(\"Test passed: Steady state conditions are satisfied.\")\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test carts-db replicas threshold')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=5, help='Duration to check the replicas')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    # Create an instance of the test class with the specified duration\n    test = TestCartsDBReplicas(duration=args.duration)\n    # Run the test\n    test.test_replicas_threshold()\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\n```2nd steady states:\n- Name: front-end-replica\n- Description: The next issue to address is the 'Single Replica Deployment' for the 'front-end' deployment. This is a critical issue because having only one replica can lead to downtime if the pod fails. To ensure the system's steady state, we need to verify that the 'front-end' deployment maintains at least one running pod at all times. This can be measured by checking the number of running pods for the 'front-end' deployment. Given that the deployment is configured to have only 1 replica, the threshold should ensure that this single replica is always ready to maintain the steady state. A reasonable threshold would be to have at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time during the monitoring period. This ensures that the system remains operational even if there are temporary issues with the pod.\n- Threshold for the steady state: At least 1 ready replica must be present 100% of the time during the monitoring period.; The steady state we are considering is the availability of the 'front-end' deployment, which currently has only one replica. The current state shows that the 'front-end' deployment has 1 ready replica consistently over a monitoring period of 5 seconds. To ensure the system remains operational, the threshold should be set such that the 'front-end' deployment maintains at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time during the monitoring period. This accounts for the fact that there is only one replica, and any downtime would mean the service is unavailable. Given the current state satisfies this condition, the threshold should be set to ensure that at least 1 ready replica is present 100% of the time during the monitoring period.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestFrontEndReplica(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self, namespace, deployment_name, duration):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.namespace = namespace\n        self.deployment_name = deployment_name\n        self.duration = duration\n        # Use AppsV1Api to interact with deployments\n        self.apps_v1 = client.AppsV1Api()\n\n    def test_steady_state(self):\n        ready_replicas_count = 0\n\n        # Loop for the specified duration\n        for _ in range(self.duration):\n            # Get the deployment status\n            resp = self.apps_v1.read_namespaced_deployment_status(self.deployment_name, self.namespace)\n            ready_replicas = resp.status.ready_replicas or 0\n            print(f\"Ready replicas for {self.deployment_name}: {ready_replicas}\")\n\n            # Check if the number of ready replicas is at least 1\n            if ready_replicas >= 1:\n                ready_replicas_count += 1\n\n            # Wait for 1 second before the next check\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the percentage of time the deployment was ready\n        readiness_percentage = (ready_replicas_count / self.duration) * 100\n        print(f\"{self.deployment_name} was ready {ready_replicas_count}/{self.duration} times.\")\n\n        # Assert that the deployment was ready 100% of the time\n        assert readiness_percentage == 100, f\"{self.deployment_name} readiness was {readiness_percentage}%, expected 100%.\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Test front-end replica readiness')\n    parser.add_argument('--duration', type=int, default=5, help='Duration to check the replicas')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    # Create a test instance and run the test\n    test = TestFrontEndReplica('sock-shop', 'front-end', args.duration)\n    test.test_steady_state()\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\nA fault scenario that may occur in my system and may affect the steady states:\n\nAn assumed fault scenario is as follows:\n- Event: Black Friday Sale\n- Used Chaos Engineering tool: Chaos Mesh\n- Faults to simulate the event: [[{'name': 'StressChaos', 'name_id': 0, 'scope': {'namespace': 'sock-shop', 'label': 'name=carts-db'}}], [{'name': 'PodChaos', 'name_id': 0, 'scope': {'namespace': 'sock-shop', 'label': 'name=front-end'}}]]\n- Description: During a Black Friday sale, the system is expected to handle a significant increase in traffic, which can stress the system's resources and reveal weaknesses. The 'carts-db' deployment lacks resource requests, which can lead to scheduling issues under resource pressure. The 'front-end' deployment has only one replica, making it a single point of failure. To simulate the Black Friday event, we will first inject a 'StressChaos' fault to simulate high CPU usage on the 'carts-db' pods, testing if the system can maintain the steady state of having at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time and 2 ready replicas 80% of the time. Next, we will inject a 'PodChaos' fault to kill the 'front-end' pod, testing if the system can maintain the steady state of having at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time. This sequence simulates the increased load and potential failures during a high-traffic event like Black Friday.\n\nPlease follow the instructions below regarding Chaos Engineering as necessary:\n- The Chaos-Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute.\n- When using k6 in steady-state definition, always select a request URL from the following options (other requests are invalid):\n  1. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/\n  2. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/catalogue?size=10\n  3. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/detail.html?id=<ID>\n  Replace <ID> with an available ID: [`03fef6ac-1896-4ce8-bd69-b798f85c6e0b`, `3395a43e-2d88-40de-b95f-e00e1502085b`, `510a0d7e-8e83-4193-b483-e27e09ddc34d`, `808a2de1-1aaa-4c25-a9b9-6612e8f29a38`, `819e1fbf-8b7e-4f6d-811f-693534916a8b`, `837ab141-399e-4c1f-9abc-bace40296bac`, `a0a4f044-b040-410d-8ead-4de0446aec7e`, `d3588630-ad8e-49df-bbd7-3167f7efb246`, `zzz4f044-b040-410d-8ead-4de0446aec7e`]\n  4. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/category/\n  5. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/category?tags=<TAG>\n  Replace <TAG> with an available tag: [`magic`, `action`, `blue`, `brown`, `black`, `sport`, `formal`, `red`, `green`, `skin`, `geek`]\n  6. http://front-end.sock-shop.svc.cluster.local/basket.html\n\nNow, please detail the parameters of the fault \"PodChaos({'namespace': 'sock-shop', 'label': 'name=front-end'})\".\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema.
