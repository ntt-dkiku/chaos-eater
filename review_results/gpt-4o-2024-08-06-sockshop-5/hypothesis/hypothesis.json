The 'carts-db' deployment lacks resource requests, which can lead to scheduling issues under resource pressure. The 'front-end' deployment has only one replica, making it a single point of failure. To simulate the Black Friday event, we will first inject a 'StressChaos' fault to simulate high CPU usage on the 'carts-db' pods, testing if the system can maintain the steady state of having at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time and 2 ready replicas 80% of the time. Next, we will inject a 'PodChaos' fault to kill the 'front-end' pod, testing if the system can maintain the steady state of having at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time. This sequence simulates the increased load and potential failures during a high-traffic event like Black Friday."
