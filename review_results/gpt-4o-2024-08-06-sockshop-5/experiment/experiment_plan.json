        "thought": "The chaos engineering experiment is designed to test the system's resilience under stress conditions and potential failures. Given the constraints, the experiment must be completed within 1 minute. The experiment is divided into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation. \n\n1. **Pre-validation Phase**: This phase ensures that the system is in a steady state before any faults are injected. We will allocate 20 seconds for this phase. During this time, we will verify that the 'carts-db' deployment maintains at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time and 2 ready replicas 80% of the time, and that the 'front-end' deployment maintains at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time.\n\n2. **Fault-injection Phase**: This phase involves injecting faults to simulate the Black Friday event. We will allocate 20 seconds for this phase. The faults include a 'StressChaos' fault to simulate high CPU usage on the 'carts-db' pods and a 'PodChaos' fault to kill the 'front-end' pod. These faults will test the system's ability to maintain the defined steady states under stress and failure conditions.\n\n3. **Post-validation Phase**: This phase ensures that the system returns to its steady state after the faults are removed. We will allocate 20 seconds for this phase. During this time, we will again verify the steady states for the 'carts-db' and 'front-end' deployments to ensure they meet the defined thresholds.\n\nThe total time for the experiment is 60 seconds, with each phase receiving an equal allocation of 20 seconds. This allocation allows for a balanced approach to validating the system's steady state, injecting faults, and confirming recovery.",

This involves verifying that the current state of the system meets the defined steady state thresholds. Given the constraints of a 20-second total time for this phase, we will execute the unit tests for both steady states simultaneously to maximize efficiency. The first steady state, 'carts-db-replicas', requires checking that at least 1 replica is ready 100% of the time and 2 replicas are ready at least 80% of the time. The second steady state, 'front-end-replica', requires ensuring that the single replica is ready 100% of the time. Both tests will run for the full 20 seconds, with checks occurring every second. This approach ensures that we have sufficient data to confirm the system's readiness before proceeding to the fault injection phase.",

The goal is to observe how the system behaves under stress and potential failure conditions. The phase is limited to 20 seconds, so we need to carefully time the injections and tests to fit within this window.\n\nFirst, we will inject a 'StressChaos' fault on the 'carts-db' deployment to simulate high CPU usage. This will help us test the system's ability to maintain the steady state of having at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time and 2 ready replicas 80% of the time. We will start this fault injection immediately at the beginning of the phase and let it run for 10 seconds.\n\nSimultaneously, we will run the unit test for the 'carts-db-replicas' steady state to verify if the system can maintain the required number of ready replicas during the stress period. This test will also start at the beginning of the phase and run for 10 seconds.\n\nNext, we will inject a 'PodChaos' fault to kill the 'front-end' pod. This will test the system's ability to maintain the steady state of having at least 1 ready replica 100% of the time for the 'front-end' deployment. We will start this fault injection at the 10-second mark and let it run for 5 seconds.\n\nFinally, we will run the unit test for the 'front-end-replica' steady state to verify if the system can maintain the required readiness during the pod failure. This test will start at the 10-second mark and run for 5 seconds.\n\nBy staggering the fault injections and unit tests in this manner, we can effectively simulate the Black Friday scenario and assess the system's resilience under stress and failure conditions.",
