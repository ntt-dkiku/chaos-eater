        "summary": "The hypothesis aims to ensure that the system maintains its steady states even when faults are injected, focusing on the 'carts-db' and 'front-end' deployments.",
        "strengths": "- Clearly defines the steady states for 'carts-db' and 'front-end'.\n- Uses specific thresholds to measure steady state maintenance.\n- Provides detailed Python scripts for verification.\n- Considers critical issues like resource requests and single replica deployment.\n- Aligns with the expected behavior during a high-traffic event.",
        "weaknesses": "- The hypothesis could benefit from including more diverse fault scenarios.\n- It assumes the system's current configuration is optimal without exploring other potential issues.\n- The focus is limited to only two components, potentially overlooking other critical parts of the system.\n- The hypothesis does not account for network-related faults.\n- It lacks consideration for external dependencies that might affect the system.",

        "weaknesses": "- The experiment duration is very short, which might not capture all potential issues.\n- Limited to CPU stress and pod kill faults, missing other types of faults.\n- The experiment could benefit from more extensive monitoring and logging.\n- The plan does not account for potential network delays or failures.\n- The experiment might not scale well for larger systems.",
