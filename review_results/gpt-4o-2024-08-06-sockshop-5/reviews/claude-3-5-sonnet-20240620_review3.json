        "summary": "The hypothesis aims to verify that the system maintains its steady states even when subjected to fault scenarios simulating a Black Friday sale event. It focuses on two key components: the 'carts-db' deployment and the 'front-end' deployment.",
        "strengths": "\u2022 Clear definition of steady states for both 'carts-db' and 'front-end' deployments\n\u2022 Specific thresholds set for each steady state\n\u2022 Consideration of real-world scenario (Black Friday sale)\n\u2022 Use of custom Python scripts to verify steady states",
        "weaknesses": "\u2022 Limited scope - only focuses on two components of the system\n\u2022 Does not consider potential cascading effects on other services\n\u2022 Thresholds may not be stringent enough for a high-traffic event like Black Friday",
        "score_reason": "The hypothesis is well-defined and relevant to the system, addressing critical issues identified in the initial analysis. It leads to system improvement by highlighting the need for increased replicas in the front-end deployment. The hypothesis also offers insights for future improvements, such as considering resource requests for other components. However, it could be more comprehensive by including other critical services in the sock-shop application.",

        "summary": "The experiment is designed to test the system's resilience under simulated Black Friday conditions, focusing on the 'carts-db' and 'front-end' deployments. It's structured into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation, each lasting 20 seconds.",

        "score_reason": "The experiment plan correctly serves to validate the hypothesis by testing the defined steady states under fault conditions. It is set up considering an actual failure scenario (Black Friday sale) and uses appropriate chaos engineering tools. However, the short duration and limited scope of faults prevent it from being a comprehensive test of the system's resilience.",

        "summary": "The analysis report provides a detailed breakdown of the experiment results across all three phases. It identifies that while the 'carts-db' deployment maintained its steady state throughout the experiment, the 'front-end' deployment failed during both the fault-injection and post-validation phases in the first try.",
