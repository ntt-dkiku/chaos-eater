    "hypothesis": {
        "summary": "The hypothesis aimed to ensure that the system maintains its steady states even when faults are injected, focusing on the 'carts-db' and 'front-end' deployments.",
        "strengths": "- Clearly defined steady states for critical components.\n- Utilizes specific thresholds to measure system stability.\n- Incorporates both resource and availability considerations.\n- Provides a detailed Python script for automated verification.\n- Aligns with real-world scenarios like Black Friday sales.",
        "weaknesses": "- Limited to only two steady states, potentially overlooking other critical components.\n- Assumes the current state is stable without considering historical data.\n- Does not account for network-related issues.\n- Lacks consideration for external dependencies.\n- The hypothesis could be more specific about expected outcomes beyond replica counts.",
        "score_reason": "The hypothesis is relevant and meaningful, addressing critical issues in the system. It leads to system improvement and offers insights for future cycles, warranting a score of 5.",

        "summary": "The experiment plan is structured into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation, each lasting 20 seconds, to test the system's resilience.",
        "strengths": "- Well-structured phases with clear objectives.\n- Efficient use of time constraints with simultaneous testing.\n- Incorporates both stress and failure scenarios.\n- Uses Chaos Mesh for automated fault injection.\n- Provides detailed YAML configuration for reproducibility.",
        "weaknesses": "- Limited to a 1-minute duration, which may not capture long-term effects.\n- Focuses only on CPU stress and pod failure, missing other potential faults.\n- Assumes immediate recovery post-fault without a grace period.\n- Does not include network latency or partitioning tests.\n- Could benefit from more diverse fault scenarios.",
        "score_reason": "The experiment plan correctly serves to validate the hypothesis and considers actual failure scenarios, earning a score of 4.",

        "weaknesses": "- Focuses primarily on replica counts without deeper analysis of underlying causes.\n- Does not explore potential improvements for 'carts-db' beyond current success.\n- Lacks consideration of external factors affecting system performance.\n- Could include more quantitative data analysis.\n- Does not address potential impacts on user experience.",

        "strengths": "- Directly addresses the identified issue of single replica deployment.\n- Simple yet effective change to improve availability.\n- Aligns with recommendations from the analysis phase.\n- Quick implementation with immediate impact.\n- Enhances system resilience against pod failures.",
        "weaknesses": "- Limited to a single change, potentially missing other improvements.\n- Does not address other identified issues like resource requests.\n- Lacks consideration for dynamic scaling solutions.\n- Could benefit from additional security enhancements.\n- Does not explore potential impacts on resource usage.",
