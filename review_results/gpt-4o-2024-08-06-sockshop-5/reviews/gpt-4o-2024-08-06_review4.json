        "strengths": "- Clearly defines the steady states for 'carts-db' and 'front-end'.\n- Uses specific thresholds to measure steady states.\n- Provides detailed Python scripts for testing steady states.\n- Considers critical issues like resource requests and single replica deployment.\n- Aligns with the system's expected behavior during high-traffic events.",
        "weaknesses": "- The hypothesis could be more specific about the expected behavior under different fault conditions.\n- It assumes the system's current configuration is optimal without considering potential improvements.\n- The hypothesis does not address all identified issues, such as missing liveness and readiness probes.\n- The hypothesis could include more diverse fault scenarios to test system resilience.\n- It lacks consideration for potential cascading failures in interconnected services.",
