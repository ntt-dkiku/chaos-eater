        "score_reason": "The hypothesis is well-defined and relevant to the system, addressing critical issues identified in the initial analysis. It leads to system improvement by highlighting the need for increased replicas in the front-end deployment. The hypothesis also offers insights for future improvements, such as considering resource requests for other components. However, it could be more comprehensive by including other critical services in the sock-shop application.",

        "score_reason": "The experiment plan is well-designed and serves to validate the hypothesis effectively. It uses relevant fault scenarios that simulate real-world issues. The use of Chaos Mesh for automated execution is a strong point.

It clearly identifies the issue with the 'front-end' deployment and offers a concrete solution. The analysis of the second try confirms the effectiveness of the improvement.

The modification of increasing the number of replicas for the 'front-end' deployment directly addresses the identified issue and results in all tests passing in the second try.
