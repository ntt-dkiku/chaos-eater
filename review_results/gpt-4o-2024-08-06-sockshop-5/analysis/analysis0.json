    "report": "The chaos engineering experiment aimed to test the resilience of the 'sock-shop' system under simulated fault conditions, specifically focusing on the 'carts-db' and 'front-end' deployments. The experiment was structured into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation. The results indicate that while the 'carts-db' deployment maintained its steady state throughout the experiment, the 'front-end' deployment failed to meet the expected steady state during both the fault-injection and post-validation phases.\n\n1. **Pre-Validation Phase:**\n   - Both the 'carts-db-replicas' and 'front-end-replica' tests passed, indicating that the system was in a stable state before any faults were injected. This confirms that the initial configuration of the system was functioning as expected.\n\n2. **Fault-Injected Phase:**\n   - The 'carts-db-replicas' test passed during the fault-injection phase, demonstrating that the 'carts-db' deployment was resilient to the 'StressChaos' fault, which simulated high CPU usage. This suggests that despite the lack of resource requests, the 'carts-db' deployment was able to maintain at least one ready replica 100% of the time and two ready replicas 80% of the time.\n   - The 'front-end-replica' test failed during the fault-injection phase. The 'PodChaos' fault, which involved killing the 'front-end' pod, resulted in 0 ready replicas throughout the test duration. This failure highlights the critical issue of having only a single replica for the 'front-end' deployment, making it a single point of failure. The system was unable to recover or maintain availability when the single pod was terminated.\n\n3. **Post-Validation Phase:**\n   - The 'carts-db-replicas' test continued to pass in the post-validation phase, indicating that the 'carts-db' deployment returned to its steady state after the fault was removed.\n   - The 'front-end-replica' test failed again in the post-validation phase, with 0 ready replicas recorded throughout the test. This suggests that the 'front-end' deployment did not recover after the fault was removed, likely due to the absence of additional replicas to take over when the single pod was killed.\n\n**Insights and Recommendations:**\n- The failure of the 'front-end' deployment to maintain its steady state during and after the fault-injection phase underscores the importance of addressing the 'Single Replica Deployment' issue. To improve resilience, it is recommended to increase the number of replicas for the 'front-end' deployment. This will ensure that the system can maintain availability even if one pod fails.\n- Consider implementing horizontal pod autoscaling for the 'front-end' deployment to dynamically adjust the number of replicas based on traffic and resource usage. This can help the system handle sudden spikes in demand, such as those experienced during events like Black Friday.\n- Review and potentially adjust the readiness and liveness probes for the 'front-end' deployment to ensure that Kubernetes can accurately determine the health of the pods and take corrective actions if necessary.\n\nBy addressing these issues, the system's resilience can be significantly improved, reducing the risk of downtime during high-traffic events and fault scenarios."
