The Pod runs an Nginx container, which is a popular web server used to serve static content, reverse proxy, or load balance HTTP traffic. The Service is configured to expose this Pod on port 80, which is the default port for HTTP traffic. Given the use of Nginx and the configuration of the Service, it is logical to assume that these manifests are intended to deploy a simple web server application.
