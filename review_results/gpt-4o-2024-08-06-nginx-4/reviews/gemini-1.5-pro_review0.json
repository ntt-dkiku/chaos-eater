        "weaknesses": "- The hypothesis could be more specific about the expected behavior under the fault scenario. While it states that steady states should be maintained, it doesn't quantify the acceptable deviation from the normal operating conditions.\n- The hypothesis could benefit from considering additional steady states, such as resource utilization or error rates, to provide a more comprehensive view of the system's health.\n- The description of the steady states could be more concise.\n- The hypothesis doesn't explicitly mention the expected duration of the steady state deviations during the fault injection.",

Collecting data on resource utilization, error rates, and other relevant metrics would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the system's behavior under stress.\n- The experiment plan could be more robust by including a wider range of fault scenarios. While the chosen faults are relevant, exploring other potential failures would provide a more complete picture of the system's resilience.\n- The experiment plan could be improved by adding more details about the expected results of the unit tests during the fault injection phase.

Describing how the system responded to the faults and the specific impact on the steady states would provide more valuable insights.\n- The analysis could be more comprehensive by considering the potential impact of the failures on downstream services or users.

While the implemented change is significant, considering other aspects of resilience would further strengthen the system.\n- The improvement could be more robust by including automated testing to verify the changes. While the subsequent experiment confirms the improvement, incorporating automated tests would provide more confidence in the changes.\n- The improvement could be more flexible by allowing for configuration of the number of replicas. While three replicas are a good starting point, providing a way to adjust the replica count based on the system's needs would be beneficial.\n- The improvement could be more transparent by providing more details about the decision-making process behind the chosen solution.
