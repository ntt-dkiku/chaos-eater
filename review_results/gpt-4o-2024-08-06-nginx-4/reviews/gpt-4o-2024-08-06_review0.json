        "strengths": "- Clearly defined steady states for both pod and service availability.\n- Utilized measurable outputs to verify steady states.\n- Addressed critical issues like pod restart policy and single pod deployment.\n",
        "weaknesses": "- The hypothesis could have been more specific about the expected behavior under each fault condition.\n- Lacked consideration for potential cascading failures beyond the immediate faults.\n- Did not account for external dependencies that might affect the system's steady states.\n",

        "weaknesses": "- The experiment could have included more diverse fault scenarios to test other potential vulnerabilities.\n- Limited time for each phase might not capture all transient issues.\n- The experiment plan could have been more detailed in terms of expected outcomes for each fault.\n",
