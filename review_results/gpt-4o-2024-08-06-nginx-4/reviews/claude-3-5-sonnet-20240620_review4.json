        "weaknesses": "\u2022 The hypothesis doesn't explicitly address the known system weaknesses (restart policy and single pod deployment)\n\u2022 The steady states don't directly test the system's ability to recover from failures\n\u2022 The hypothesis doesn't consider potential cascading effects of the faults",
        "score_reason": "The hypothesis is relevant to the system and meaningful, as it addresses critical aspects of system reliability. It leads to system improvement by revealing vulnerabilities in the initial configuration.

        "score_reason": "The experiment plan correctly serves to validate the hypothesis and is set up considering an actual failure scenario (cyber attack).
