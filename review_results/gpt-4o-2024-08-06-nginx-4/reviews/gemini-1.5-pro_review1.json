        "summary": "The hypothesis focuses on maintaining steady states ('example-pod-running' and 'example-service-availability') under a simulated cyber-attack scenario. The steady states are well-defined with clear descriptions, thresholds, and validation scripts. The cyber-attack scenario includes PodChaos (pod-kill) and NetworkChaos (network latency) to test the system's resilience.",
        "strengths": "- Clearly defined steady states with measurable outputs.\n- Relevant to the identified resiliency issues (Pod restart policy and single pod deployment).\n- Realistic fault scenario simulating a cyber attack.\n- Validation scripts provided for each steady state.\n- Thresholds for steady states are reasonable and allow for minor fluctuations.",
        "weaknesses": "- The hypothesis could be more specific about the expected behavior during fault injection. For example, it could state the expected recovery time for the service after the pod is killed.\n- The hypothesis doesn't explicitly mention the expected impact of NetworkChaos on service availability, only focusing on the pod's running state.\n- The hypothesis could be strengthened by including metrics like error rates and latency during the fault injection.\n- The hypothesis could be more focused on specific performance objectives, such as recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO).\n- The hypothesis could be made more testable by defining specific success criteria for each fault injection.",
        "score_reason": "The hypothesis is relevant to the system and meaningful, leading to system improvement and offering insights for the next cycle. It scores a 4 because while it addresses the core issues, it could be more specific about expected behavior during fault injection and include more performance-oriented metrics.",
