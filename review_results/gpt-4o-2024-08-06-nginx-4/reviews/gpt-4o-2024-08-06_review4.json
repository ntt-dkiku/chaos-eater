        "summary": "The hypothesis was well-defined, focusing on maintaining system steady states despite fault scenarios. It identified two critical steady states: the pod's running status and the service's availability, both of which are crucial given the system's configuration.",
        "strengths": "- Clearly defined steady states with measurable outputs.\n- Relevant to the system's identified weaknesses.\n- Provides a clear threshold for success.\n- Utilizes appropriate tools (Python script and K6) for validation.\n- Addresses critical issues in the system configuration.",
        "weaknesses": "- The hypothesis could be more specific about the expected behavior under each fault condition.\n- It assumes a high level of availability without considering potential external factors.\n- The hypothesis does not account for potential cascading failures.\n- Limited scope in terms of fault scenarios considered.\n- Could benefit from more detailed risk assessment.",

        "strengths": "- Well-structured phases with clear objectives.\n- Efficient use of time within the 60-second constraint.\n- Utilizes Chaos Mesh for automated fault injection.\n- Aligns unit tests with fault durations for effective observation.\n- Comprehensive coverage of both pod and service states.",
        "weaknesses": "- The experiment could benefit from more diverse fault scenarios.\n- Limited time for each phase may not capture all potential issues.\n- The plan assumes immediate system stabilization post-fault.\n- Could include more detailed logging for better analysis.\n- Potentially overlooks external dependencies affecting results.",
        "score_reason": "The experiment plan correctly serves to validate the hypothesis and is set up considering actual failure scenarios. However, it could be enhanced with more diverse fault scenarios and detailed logging.",
