        "weaknesses": "\u2022 The hypothesis doesn't explicitly address the known system weaknesses (restart policy and single pod deployment)\n\u2022 The steady states don't directly test the system's ability to recover from failures\n\u2022 The hypothesis doesn't consider potential cascading effects of the simulated cyber attack",
        "score_reason": "The hypothesis is relevant to the system and meaningful, addressing key aspects of system resilience. It leads to system improvement by revealing critical vulnerabilities. However, it could be more comprehensive in addressing known weaknesses and recovery capabilities.",

        "summary": "The experiment is divided into three phases: pre-validation (15s), fault-injection (30s), and post-validation (15s).
