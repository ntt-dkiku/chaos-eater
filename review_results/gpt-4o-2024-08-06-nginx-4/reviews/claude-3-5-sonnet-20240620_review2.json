        "summary": "The hypothesis aims to verify that the system maintains its steady states even when subjected to a simulated cyber attack. Two steady states are defined: the 'example-pod' running status and the 'example-service' availability.",

        "weaknesses": "\u2022 Initial hypothesis does not account for the system's lack of redundancy\n\u2022 The 'Never' restart policy for the pod is not addressed in the initial hypothesis\n\u2022 The hypothesis does not consider potential recovery time after fault injection\n\u2022 Limited scope of steady states, focusing only on pod running status and service availability",
        "score_reason": "The hypothesis is relevant to the system and meaningful, addressing critical aspects of system resilience. It leads to system improvement by revealing vulnerabilities in the initial configuration.
