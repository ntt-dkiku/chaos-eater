        "strengths": "- Clearly defines two relevant steady states.\n- Directly addresses the identified resiliency issues.\n- Provides measurable outputs for each steady state.\n- Sets specific thresholds for each steady state.\n- Includes scripts to verify the steady states.",
        "weaknesses": "- The hypothesis could be more specific by explicitly stating the expected behavior of the steady states under the defined fault scenario.\n- The description of the steady states could be more concise.\n- The threshold for 'example-pod-running' (90%) seems a bit low, considering the criticality of the Pod.\n- The K6 script for 'example-service-availability' could include more checks, such as response time, to provide a more comprehensive view of the service's health.\n- The hypothesis doesn't explicitly mention the expected impact of NetworkChaos on the service availability.",

Exploring additional scenarios, such as resource exhaustion or node failures, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the system's resilience.\n- The experiment relies on manual analysis of logs. Automating the analysis process would improve efficiency and reduce the risk of human error.\n- The experiment does not consider the potential impact of the faults on other parts of the system or dependencies.\n- The experiment could include more sophisticated checks in the unit tests, such as measuring the impact on application performance.",
