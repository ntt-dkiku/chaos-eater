        "summary": "The hypothesis aimed to ensure that the system maintains its steady states even when faults are injected, focusing on the Pod's running status and the Service's availability.",
        "strengths": "- Clearly defined steady states for both the Pod and the Service.\n- Utilized measurable outputs to verify the steady states.\n- Addressed critical issues related to Pod restart policy and single Pod deployment.",
        "weaknesses": "- The hypothesis could have been more specific about the expected behavior under fault conditions.\n- Lacked consideration for potential cascading failures beyond the immediate Pod and Service.\n- Did not account for external dependencies that might affect the system's steady states.",

        "summary": "The experiment was well-structured, with clear phases for pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation, all within a 60-second timeframe.",
        "strengths": "- Efficient time allocation across phases.\n- Comprehensive fault-injection using PodChaos and NetworkChaos.\n- Aligned unit tests with fault durations for effective observation.",
        "weaknesses": "- The experiment could have included more diverse fault scenarios.\n- Limited time for each phase might not capture all potential issues.\n- The use of a single Pod initially limited the scope of the experiment.",

        "strengths": "- Thorough identification of issues causing failures.\n- Provided actionable recommendations for improvement.\n- Highlighted the impact of faults on system availability.",
        "weaknesses": "- Could have explored potential secondary effects of the faults.\n- Limited discussion on the impact of network latency on service performance.\n- Did not consider potential improvements in monitoring and alerting.",

        "summary": "The improvement involved replacing the Pod with a Deployment, addressing the issues of redundancy and automatic recovery.",
        "strengths": "- Successfully changed the system to satisfy the hypothesis.\n- Implemented redundancy with multiple replicas.\n- Enhanced system resilience against similar fault scenarios.",
        "weaknesses": "- The improvement focused solely on the Pod, with no changes to the Service configuration.\n- Did not address potential network-related improvements.\n- Limited consideration for scaling beyond the current setup.",
