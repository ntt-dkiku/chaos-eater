    "hypothesis": {
        "summary": "The hypothesis was well-defined, focusing on maintaining system steady states despite fault scenarios. It identified two critical steady states: the pod's running status and the service's availability, both crucial for system reliability.",
        "strengths": "- Clearly defined steady states with measurable outputs.\n- Addressed critical issues like pod restart policy and single pod deployment.\n- Provided detailed scripts for verifying steady states.\n- Considered realistic thresholds for steady states.\n- Aligned with the system's known weaknesses.",
        "weaknesses": "- The hypothesis could have included more diverse fault scenarios.\n- It relied heavily on the assumption that the pod would be running 90% of the time, which might not account for all real-world scenarios.\n- The hypothesis did not consider potential cascading failures beyond the pod and service.\n- Limited focus on network-related issues beyond latency.\n- Could have explored more complex interactions between components.",

        "strengths": "- Well-structured phases with clear objectives.\n- Efficient time allocation across phases.\n- Use of Chaos Mesh for automated execution.\n- Detailed unit tests for steady state verification.\n- Consideration of both pod and network faults.",
        "weaknesses": "- The experiment could have included more diverse fault types.\n- Limited duration for each phase might not capture all potential issues.\n- The plan did not account for potential cascading failures.\n- Could have explored more complex fault interactions.\n- Relied on a single tool (Chaos Mesh) for fault injection.",
