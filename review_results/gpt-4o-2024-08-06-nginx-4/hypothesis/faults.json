    "description": "Given the system's weaknesses, a cyber attack targeting the single Pod and its network could be highly impactful. The Pod's restart policy set to 'Never' means that if the Pod fails, it will not restart, leading to downtime. Additionally, the single Pod deployment means there is no redundancy, so any failure will make the service unavailable. To simulate a cyber attack, we can start by injecting a PodChaos fault to kill the Pod, testing the system's ability to handle Pod failures. This will directly exploit the lack of redundancy and the restart policy issue. Next, we can simulate a network attack using NetworkChaos to introduce network latency, testing the service's ability to maintain availability under network stress. This sequence simulates a cyber attack by first taking down the Pod and then stressing the network, revealing the system's vulnerabilities in handling such scenarios."
