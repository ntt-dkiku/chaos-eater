This is a critical issue because if the Pod fails, it will not restart, leading to potential downtime. Therefore, the steady state should ensure that the Pod is running and available. A measurable output for this steady state is the number of running Pods, which should be 1, as there is only one Pod defined in the manifest. This steady state will help verify that the Pod is up and running, which is crucial given the restart policy configuration.\n\nThe steady state was inspected with the following python code of k8s client libraries:\nimport os\nimport time\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\n\n# Load Kubernetes configuration based on the environment\nif os.getenv('KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST'):\n    config.load_incluster_config()\nelse:\n    config.load_kube_config()\n\nv1 = client.CoreV1Api()\n\ndef check_pod_status(namespace, pod_name):\n    try:\n        pod = v1.read_namespaced_pod(name=pod_name, namespace=namespace)\n        return pod.status.phase == 'Running'\n    except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n        print(f\"Exception when calling CoreV1Api->read_namespaced_pod: {e}\")\n        return False\n\ndef main(duration):\n    namespace = 'default'\n    pod_name = 'example-pod'\n    running_count = 0\n    for _ in range(duration):\n        if check_pod_status(namespace, pod_name):\n            running_count += 1\n        time.sleep(1)\n    print(f\"Pod '{pod_name}' running status checked {duration} times.

The current state shows that the pod was checked 5 times over a duration of 5 seconds, and it was running each time, resulting in a running count of 5. This indicates that the pod is consistently running during the check period. Given the constraints of the chaos engineering experiment, which must be completed within 1 minute, we can set a threshold that allows for some tolerance in case of brief fluctuations. A reasonable threshold would be that the pod should be running at least 90% of the time during the check period. This allows for a small margin of error while still ensuring that the pod is generally available and running.\n\nGiven the above steady state, command, and threshold, please write a Python unit test to check if the steady state satisfies the threshold.\nThe threshold in the unit test must exactly match the threshold defined above. Implement it to support variable durations. Use a representative value (e.g., percentage, ratio, etc.) for the threshold.

This is a critical issue because if the Pod fails, it will not restart, leading to potential downtime. Therefore, the steady state should ensure that the Pod is running and available. A measurable output for this steady state is the number of running Pods, which should be 1, as there is only one Pod defined in the manifest. This steady state will help verify that the Pod is up and running, which is crucial given the restart policy configuration.\n- Threshold for the steady state: The pod should be running at least 90% of the time during the check period.; The steady state we are considering is whether the 'example-pod' is running. The current state shows that the pod was checked 5 times over a duration of 5 seconds, and it was running each time, resulting in a running count of 5. This indicates that the pod is consistently running during the check period. Given the constraints of the chaos engineering experiment, which must be completed within 1 minute, we can set a threshold that allows for some tolerance in case of brief fluctuations. A reasonable threshold would be that the pod should be running at least 90% of the time during the check period. This allows for a small margin of error while still ensuring that the pod is generally available and running.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestPodRunningState(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n\n    def check_pod_status(self, namespace, pod_name):\n        try:\n            pod = self.v1.read_namespaced_pod(name=pod_name, namespace=namespace)\n            return pod.status.phase == 'Running'\n        except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n            print(f\"Exception when calling CoreV1Api->read_namespaced_pod: {e}\")\n            return False\n\n    def test_pod_running_state(self, duration):\n        namespace = 'default'\n        pod_name = 'example-pod'\n        running_count = 0\n\n        # Check the pod status every second for the specified duration\n        for _ in range(duration):\n            if self.check_pod_status(namespace, pod_name):\n                running_count += 1\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the running percentage\n        running_percentage = (running_count / duration) * 100\n\n        # Assert that the running percentage is at least 90%\n        assert running_percentage >= 90, f\"Pod '{pod_name}' running percentage is below threshold: {running_percentage}%\"\n\n        print(f\"Pod '{pod_name}' running status checked {duration} times.

If the namespace is specified in the manifest, it is deployed with the namespace. If not, it is deployed with the 'default' namespace.\n- The parameters follow the format of Chaos Mesh.\nHuman: Here is the overview of my system:\nThe system consists of the following K8s manifest(s):K8s manifest: nginx/pod.yaml\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: example-pod\n  labels:\n    app: example\nspec:\n  restartPolicy: Never\n  containers:\n  - name: example-container\n    image: nginx:1.17.1\n    ports:\n    - containerPort: 80\n```\nSummary of nginx/pod.yaml:\n- This manifest defines a Kubernetes Pod.\n- The Pod is named 'example-pod'.\n- It includes metadata with a label 'app: example'.\n- The Pod's restart policy is set to 'Never', meaning it won't restart automatically if it fails.\n- The Pod contains one container named 'example-container'.\n- The container uses the 'nginx:1.17.1' image, which is a specific version of the Nginx web server.\n- The container exposes port 80, which is commonly used for HTTP traffic.\n\nK8s manifest: nginx/service.yaml\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: example-service\nspec:\n  selector:\n    app: example\n  ports:\n    - protocol: TCP\n      port: 80\n      targetPort: 80\n```\nSummary of nginx/service.yaml:\n- This manifest defines a Kubernetes Service.\n- The Service is named 'example-service'.\n- It uses the 'v1' API version.\n- The Service selects pods with the label 'app: example'.\n- It exposes the Service on port 80 using the TCP protocol.\n- The Service forwards traffic to the target port 80 on the selected pods.\n\nThe resiliency issues/weaknesses in the system are as follows:\nIssue #0: Pod Restart Policy\n  - details: The Pod will not restart automatically if it fails, which can lead to downtime.\n  - manifests having the issues: ['nginx/pod.yaml']\n  - problematic config: restartPolicy: Never\n\nIssue #1: Single Pod Deployment\n  - details: Having a single Pod means there is no redundancy. If the Pod fails, the service will be unavailable.\n  - manifests having the issues: ['nginx/pod.yaml']\n  - problematic config: Only one Pod is defined without a Deployment or ReplicaSet.\n\nThe expected type of application on the system (i.e., K8s manfests):\nA simple web server application using Nginx to serve HTTP content.; The manifests provided define a Kubernetes Pod and a Service. The Pod runs an Nginx container, which is a popular web server used to serve static content, reverse proxy, or load balance HTTP traffic. The Service is configured to expose this Pod on port 80, which is the default port for HTTP traffic. Given the use of Nginx and the configuration of the Service, it is logical to assume that these manifests are intended to deploy a simple web server application. The file names and the use of Nginx further support this assumption.\n\nSteady states of my system:\n2 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: example-pod-running\n- Description: The first issue to address is the Pod's restart policy set to 'Never'. This is a critical issue because if the Pod fails, it will not restart, leading to potential downtime. Therefore, the steady state should ensure that the Pod is running and available. A measurable output for this steady state is the number of running Pods, which should be 1, as there is only one Pod defined in the manifest. This steady state will help verify that the Pod is up and running, which is crucial given the restart policy configuration.\n- Threshold for the steady state: The pod should be running at least 90% of the time during the check period.; The steady state we are considering is whether the 'example-pod' is running. The current state shows that the pod was checked 5 times over a duration of 5 seconds, and it was running each time, resulting in a running count of 5. This indicates that the pod is consistently running during the check period. Given the constraints of the chaos engineering experiment, which must be completed within 1 minute, we can set a threshold that allows for some tolerance in case of brief fluctuations. A reasonable threshold would be that the pod should be running at least 90% of the time during the check period. This allows for a small margin of error while still ensuring that the pod is generally available and running.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestPodRunningState(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n\n    def check_pod_status(self, namespace, pod_name):\n        try:\n            pod = self.v1.read_namespaced_pod(name=pod_name, namespace=namespace)\n            return pod.status.phase == 'Running'\n        except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n            print(f\"Exception when calling CoreV1Api->read_namespaced_pod: {e}\")\n            return False\n\n    def test_pod_running_state(self, duration):\n        namespace = 'default'\n        pod_name = 'example-pod'\n        running_count = 0\n\n        # Check the pod status every second for the specified duration\n        for _ in range(duration):\n            if self.check_pod_status(namespace, pod_name):\n                running_count += 1\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the running percentage\n        running_percentage = (running_count / duration) * 100\n\n        # Assert that the running percentage is at least 90%\n        assert running_percentage >= 90, f\"Pod '{pod_name}' running percentage is below threshold: {running_percentage}%\"\n\n        print(f\"Pod '{pod_name}' running status checked {duration} times.

This sequence simulates a cyber attack by first taking down the Pod and then stressing the network, revealing the system's vulnerabilities in handling such scenarios.\n\nPlease follow the instructions below regarding Chaos Engineering as necessary:\n- The Chaos-Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute.\n\nNow, please detail the parameters of the fault \"NetworkChaos({'service': 'example-service'})\".\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema.
