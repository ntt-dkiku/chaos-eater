If the Pod fails, the service will be unavailable.\n  - manifests having the issues: ['nginx/pod.yaml']\n  - problematic config: Only one Pod is defined without a Deployment or ReplicaSet.\n\nThe expected type of application on the system (i.e., K8s manfests):\nA simple web server application using Nginx to serve HTTP content.; The manifests provided define a Kubernetes Pod and a Service. The Pod runs an Nginx container, which is a popular web server used to serve static content, reverse proxy, or load balance HTTP traffic. The Service is configured to expose this Pod on port 80, which is the default port for HTTP traffic. Given the use of Nginx and the configuration of the Service, it is logical to assume that these manifests are intended to deploy a simple web server application. The file names and the use of Nginx further support this assumption.\n\n# Steady states of my system:\n2 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: example-pod-running\n- Description: The first issue to address is the Pod's restart policy set to 'Never'. This is a critical issue because if the Pod fails, it will not restart, leading to potential downtime. Therefore, the steady state should ensure that the Pod is running and available. A measurable output for this steady state is the number of running Pods, which should be 1, as there is only one Pod defined in the manifest. This steady state will help verify that the Pod is up and running, which is crucial given the restart policy configuration.\n- Threshold for the steady state: The pod should be running at least 90% of the time during the check period.; The steady state we are considering is whether the 'example-pod' is running. The current state shows that the pod was checked 5 times over a duration of 5 seconds, and it was running each time, resulting in a running count of 5. This indicates that the pod is consistently running during the check period. Given the constraints of the chaos engineering experiment, which must be completed within 1 minute, we can set a threshold that allows for some tolerance in case of brief fluctuations. A reasonable threshold would be that the pod should be running at least 90% of the time during the check period. This allows for a small margin of error while still ensuring that the pod is generally available and running.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestPodRunningState(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n\n    def check_pod_status(self, namespace, pod_name):\n        try:\n            pod = self.v1.read_namespaced_pod(name=pod_name, namespace=namespace)\n            return pod.status.phase == 'Running'\n        except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n            print(f\"Exception when calling CoreV1Api->read_namespaced_pod: {e}\")\n            return False\n\n    def test_pod_running_state(self, duration):\n        namespace = 'default'\n        pod_name = 'example-pod'\n        running_count = 0\n\n        # Check the pod status every second for the specified duration\n        for _ in range(duration):\n            if self.check_pod_status(namespace, pod_name):\n                running_count += 1\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the running percentage\n        running_percentage = (running_count / duration) * 100\n\n        # Assert that the running percentage is at least 90%\n        assert running_percentage >= 90, f\"Pod '{pod_name}' running percentage is below threshold: {running_percentage}%\"\n\n        print(f\"Pod '{pod_name}' running status checked {duration} times.

This is a significant issue because if the single Pod fails, the service will be unavailable. To verify this, we can define a steady state that checks the availability of the service itself. A measurable output for this steady state is the service's response time or availability. Since the service is exposed on port 80, we can check if the service is responding to HTTP requests. This steady state will help verify that the service is available and responsive, which is crucial given the single Pod deployment configuration.\n- Threshold for the steady state: Service availability should be at least 99.9% with a response status of 200.; The steady state we are considering is the availability of the 'example-service'. The k6 test results show that the service is currently responding with a 200 status code for all requests, indicating 100% availability. Given that the system consists of a single Pod, any failure in the Pod would result in the service being unavailable. Therefore, the threshold should ensure that the service remains available and responsive. To account for minor fluctuations and network latency, a reasonable threshold would be to maintain a high availability percentage, slightly below 100% to allow for brief, non-critical failures. A threshold of 99.9% availability is a common standard for web services, allowing for some tolerance while still ensuring high reliability.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following K6 Javascript:\n```\nimport http from 'k6/http';\nimport { check } from 'k6';\n\nexport const options = {\n  vus: 1,\n  duration: '5s',\n  thresholds: {\n    // Ensure that the service availability is at least 99.9%\n    'http_req_failed': ['rate<=0.001'], // 0.1% failure rate corresponds to 99.9% availability\n  },\n};\n\nexport default function () {\n  const res = http.get('http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:80');\n  check(res, {\n    'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,\n  });\n}\n\n```\n\n# A fault scenario that may occur in my system and may affect the steady states:\n\nAn assumed fault scenario is as follows:\n- Event: Cyber Attack\n- Used Chaos Engineering tool: Chaos Mesh\n- Faults to simulate the event: [[Fault(name='PodChaos', name_id=0, params={'action': 'pod-kill', 'mode': 'one', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}})], [Fault(name='NetworkChaos', name_id=1, params={'action': 'delay', 'direction': 'to', 'target': {'mode': 'all', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}}, 'mode': 'all', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}, 'device': 'eth0', 'delay': {'latency': '100ms', 'jitter': '10ms', 'correlation': '50'}})]]\n- Description: Given the system's weaknesses, a cyber attack targeting the single Pod and its network could be highly impactful. The Pod's restart policy set to 'Never' means that if the Pod fails, it will not restart, leading to downtime. Additionally, the single Pod deployment means there is no redundancy, so any failure will make the service unavailable. To simulate a cyber attack, we can start by injecting a PodChaos fault to kill the Pod, testing the system's ability to handle Pod failures. This will directly exploit the lack of redundancy and the restart policy issue. Next, we can simulate a network attack using NetworkChaos to introduce network latency, testing the service's ability to maintain availability under network stress. This sequence simulates a cyber attack by first taking down the Pod and then stressing the network, revealing the system's vulnerabilities in handling such scenarios.\n\n# Please follow the instructions below regarding Chaos Engineering as necessary:\n- The Chaos-Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute.\n\nNow, please plan a Chaos Engineering experiment to check the network system's resiliency that the steady states are remained during fault injection.\nAI: ```json\n{\"thought\":"

            "{\"thought\": \"Given the constraints of the chaos engineering experiment, which must be completed within 1 minute, we need to allocate time efficiently across the three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation. The pre-validation phase is crucial to ensure that the system is in a steady state before we introduce any faults. Since we have two steady states to validate, we should allocate a reasonable amount of time to check both the pod's running status and the service's availability. A duration of 15 seconds should be sufficient for pre-validation, allowing us to run the necessary checks multiple times. The fault-injection phase is where we introduce the chaos to observe the system's behavior under stress. Given the complexity of the faults (PodChaos and NetworkChaos), we should allocate the majority of the time to this phase to ensure that the faults have enough time to manifest and impact the system. A duration of 30 seconds is appropriate for fault injection, allowing us to observe the system's response to both pod failure and network latency. Finally, the post-validation phase is essential to verify that the system returns to its steady states after the faults are removed. We should allocate 15 seconds for post-validation, similar to the pre-validation phase, to ensure that the system stabilizes and meets the defined thresholds for steady states.

If the Pod fails, the service will be unavailable.\n  - manifests having the issues: ['nginx/pod.yaml']\n  - problematic config: Only one Pod is defined without a Deployment or ReplicaSet.\n\nThe expected type of application on the system (i.e., K8s manfests):\nA simple web server application using Nginx to serve HTTP content.; The manifests provided define a Kubernetes Pod and a Service. The Pod runs an Nginx container, which is a popular web server used to serve static content, reverse proxy, or load balance HTTP traffic. The Service is configured to expose this Pod on port 80, which is the default port for HTTP traffic. Given the use of Nginx and the configuration of the Service, it is logical to assume that these manifests are intended to deploy a simple web server application. The file names and the use of Nginx further support this assumption.\n\n# Steady states of my system:\n2 steady states are defined.\n1st steady states:\n- Name: example-pod-running\n- Description: The first issue to address is the Pod's restart policy set to 'Never'. This is a critical issue because if the Pod fails, it will not restart, leading to potential downtime. Therefore, the steady state should ensure that the Pod is running and available. A measurable output for this steady state is the number of running Pods, which should be 1, as there is only one Pod defined in the manifest. This steady state will help verify that the Pod is up and running, which is crucial given the restart policy configuration.\n- Threshold for the steady state: The pod should be running at least 90% of the time during the check period.; The steady state we are considering is whether the 'example-pod' is running. The current state shows that the pod was checked 5 times over a duration of 5 seconds, and it was running each time, resulting in a running count of 5. This indicates that the pod is consistently running during the check period. Given the constraints of the chaos engineering experiment, which must be completed within 1 minute, we can set a threshold that allows for some tolerance in case of brief fluctuations. A reasonable threshold would be that the pod should be running at least 90% of the time during the check period. This allows for a small margin of error while still ensuring that the pod is generally available and running.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following Python script with K8s API:\n```\nimport os\nimport time\nimport argparse\nfrom kubernetes import client, config\nfrom unittest_base import K8sAPIBase\n\nclass TestPodRunningState(K8sAPIBase):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n\n    def check_pod_status(self, namespace, pod_name):\n        try:\n            pod = self.v1.read_namespaced_pod(name=pod_name, namespace=namespace)\n            return pod.status.phase == 'Running'\n        except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:\n            print(f\"Exception when calling CoreV1Api->read_namespaced_pod: {e}\")\n            return False\n\n    def test_pod_running_state(self, duration):\n        namespace = 'default'\n        pod_name = 'example-pod'\n        running_count = 0\n\n        # Check the pod status every second for the specified duration\n        for _ in range(duration):\n            if self.check_pod_status(namespace, pod_name):\n                running_count += 1\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n        # Calculate the running percentage\n        running_percentage = (running_count / duration) * 100\n\n        # Assert that the running percentage is at least 90%\n        assert running_percentage >= 90, f\"Pod '{pod_name}' running percentage is below threshold: {running_percentage}%\"\n\n        print(f\"Pod '{pod_name}' running status checked {duration} times.

This is a significant issue because if the single Pod fails, the service will be unavailable. To verify this, we can define a steady state that checks the availability of the service itself. A measurable output for this steady state is the service's response time or availability. Since the service is exposed on port 80, we can check if the service is responding to HTTP requests. This steady state will help verify that the service is available and responsive, which is crucial given the single Pod deployment configuration.\n- Threshold for the steady state: Service availability should be at least 99.9% with a response status of 200.; The steady state we are considering is the availability of the 'example-service'. The k6 test results show that the service is currently responding with a 200 status code for all requests, indicating 100% availability. Given that the system consists of a single Pod, any failure in the Pod would result in the service being unavailable. Therefore, the threshold should ensure that the service remains available and responsive. To account for minor fluctuations and network latency, a reasonable threshold would be to maintain a high availability percentage, slightly below 100% to allow for brief, non-critical failures. A threshold of 99.9% availability is a common standard for web services, allowing for some tolerance while still ensuring high reliability.\n- Whether the steady state meets the threshold is determined by the following K6 Javascript:\n```\nimport http from 'k6/http';\nimport { check } from 'k6';\n\nexport const options = {\n  vus: 1,\n  duration: '5s',\n  thresholds: {\n    // Ensure that the service availability is at least 99.9%\n    'http_req_failed': ['rate<=0.001'], // 0.1% failure rate corresponds to 99.9% availability\n  },\n};\n\nexport default function () {\n  const res = http.get('http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:80');\n  check(res, {\n    'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,\n  });\n}\n\n```\n\n# A fault scenario that may occur in my system and may affect the steady states:\n\nAn assumed fault scenario is as follows:\n- Event: Cyber Attack\n- Used Chaos Engineering tool: Chaos Mesh\n- Faults to simulate the event: [[Fault(name='PodChaos', name_id=0, params={'action': 'pod-kill', 'mode': 'one', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}})], [Fault(name='NetworkChaos', name_id=1, params={'action': 'delay', 'direction': 'to', 'target': {'mode': 'all', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}}, 'mode': 'all', 'selector': {'namespaces': ['default'], 'labelSelectors': {'app': 'example'}}, 'device': 'eth0', 'delay': {'latency': '100ms', 'jitter': '10ms', 'correlation': '50'}})]]\n- Description: Given the system's weaknesses, a cyber attack targeting the single Pod and its network could be highly impactful. The Pod's restart policy set to 'Never' means that if the Pod fails, it will not restart, leading to downtime. Additionally, the single Pod deployment means there is no redundancy, so any failure will make the service unavailable. To simulate a cyber attack, we can start by injecting a PodChaos fault to kill the Pod, testing the system's ability to handle Pod failures. This will directly exploit the lack of redundancy and the restart policy issue. Next, we can simulate a network attack using NetworkChaos to introduce network latency, testing the service's ability to maintain availability under network stress. This sequence simulates a cyber attack by first taking down the Pod and then stressing the network, revealing the system's vulnerabilities in handling such scenarios.\n\n# Please follow the instructions below regarding Chaos Engineering as necessary:\n- The Chaos-Engineering experiment must be completed within 1 minute.\n\nNow, please detail the fault-injection phase.

(grace_period + duration) should not exceed the corresponding phase's total time.\n- Never output bullet points.\n- The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"summary\": {\"title\": \"Summary\", \"description\": \"The summary of the given Chaos-Engineering-experiment plan.\", \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"required\": [\"summary\"]}\n```\n\nHuman: # Here is my Chaos-Engineering-experiment plan:\n## Time Schedule\nGiven the constraints of the chaos engineering experiment, which must be completed within 1 minute, we need to allocate time efficiently across the three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation. The pre-validation phase is crucial to ensure that the system is in a steady state before we introduce any faults. Since we have two steady states to validate, we should allocate a reasonable amount of time to check both the pod's running status and the service's availability. A duration of 15 seconds should be sufficient for pre-validation, allowing us to run the necessary checks multiple times. The fault-injection phase is where we introduce the chaos to observe the system's behavior under stress. Given the complexity of the faults (PodChaos and NetworkChaos), we should allocate the majority of the time to this phase to ensure that the faults have enough time to manifest and impact the system. A duration of 30 seconds is appropriate for fault injection, allowing us to observe the system's response to both pod failure and network latency. Finally, the post-validation phase is essential to verify that the system returns to its steady states after the faults are removed. We should allocate 15 seconds for post-validation, similar to the pre-validation phase, to ensure that the system stabilizes and meets the defined thresholds for steady states. This allocation results in a total experiment time of 60 seconds, which fits within the 1-minute constraint.\n\n## Pre-validation Phase\nIn the pre-validation phase, we need to ensure that the system is in its expected steady state before we proceed with fault injection. Given the constraints of a 15-second total time for this phase, we will conduct two unit tests to verify the steady states: one for the pod's running status and another for the service's availability. These tests will be executed sequentially due to the short duration available, ensuring that each steady state is verified independently and thoroughly. The first test will check if the 'example-pod' is running at least 90% of the time over a 5-second period. This is crucial because the pod's restart policy is set to 'Never', and we need to confirm its availability before introducing any faults. The second test will verify the 'example-service' availability, ensuring it responds with a 200 status code at least 99.9% of the time over another 5-second period. This test is essential to confirm that the service is operational and responsive, given the single pod deployment. By staggering these tests, we can focus on each steady state individually, allowing us to identify any issues before proceeding to the fault injection phase.\n- Verified Steady State #0: ```example-pod-running```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```pre-unittest-example-pod-running```  \n  - Grace Period: ```0s```  \n  - Duration: ```5s```  \n- Verified Steady State #1: ```example-service-availability```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```pre-unittest-example-service-availability```  \n  - Grace Period: ```5s```  \n  - Duration: ```5s```  \n\n\n## Fault-injection Phase \nIn this fault-injection phase, we aim to simulate a cyber attack by injecting two types of faults: PodChaos and NetworkChaos. The total duration for this phase is 30 seconds, so we need to carefully schedule the faults and unit tests to fit within this timeframe. \n\nFirst, we will inject the PodChaos fault to simulate a pod failure. This fault will be injected at the start of the phase (grace period of 0s) and will last for 10 seconds. This duration is chosen to allow enough time for the system to experience the impact of the pod being killed, given the pod's restart policy is set to 'Never'.\n\nSimultaneously, we will run the unit test for the 'example-pod-running' steady state to verify if the pod is running at least 90% of the time during the fault injection. This test will also start at 0s and run for 10 seconds, aligning with the PodChaos duration.\n\nNext, we will inject the NetworkChaos fault to simulate network latency. This fault will start at 10 seconds (after the PodChaos fault ends) and will last for 20 seconds. This staggered approach allows us to observe the system's behavior under network stress after the pod failure has been simulated.\n\nDuring the NetworkChaos fault, we will run the unit test for the 'example-service-availability' steady state. This test will start at 10 seconds and run for 20 seconds, matching the NetworkChaos duration. This ensures we are checking the service's availability and response time while the network is under stress.\n\nBy staggering the faults and aligning the unit tests with the fault durations, we can effectively observe the system's behavior under each fault condition and verify if the steady states are maintained.\n- Verified Steady State #0: ```example-pod-running```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```fault-unittest-example-pod-running```  \n  - Grace Period: ```0s```  \n  - Duration: ```10s```  \n- Verified Steady State #1: ```example-service-availability```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```fault-unittest-example-service-availability```  \n  - Grace Period: ```10s```  \n  - Duration: ```20s```  \n\n\n- Injected Faults #0: ```PodChaos```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```fault-podchaos```  \n  - Grace Period: ```0s```  \n  - Duration: ```10s```  \n- Injected Faults #1: ```NetworkChaos```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```fault-networkchaos```  \n  - Grace Period: ```10s```  \n  - Duration: ```20s```  \n\n\n## Post-validation phase\nIn the post-validation phase, we need to ensure that the system has returned to its steady states after the fault injection. Given the 15-second time constraint, we will perform quick checks to verify the steady states. The two steady states to verify are: 1) the 'example-pod' is running, and 2) the 'example-service' is available. We will execute these checks sequentially due to the short duration, ensuring each test has enough time to gather meaningful data. The first test will check the pod's running status, followed by the service availability test. This order is logical because the pod must be running for the service to be available. Each test will have a brief grace period to allow the system to stabilize after the fault injection, followed by a short duration to perform the checks.\n- Verified Steady State #0: ```example-pod-running```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```post-unittest-example-pod-running```  \n  - Grace Period: ```2s```  \n  - Duration: ```6s```  \n- Verified Steady State #1: ```example-service-availability```  \n  - Workflow Name: ```post-unittest-example-service-availability```  \n  - Grace Period: ```8s```  \n  - Duration: ```5s```  \n\n\nPlease summarize the above plan.\n\nAI: ```json\n{\"summary\":"

            "{\"summary\":\"The chaos engineering experiment is structured into three phases: pre-validation, fault-injection, and post-validation, all to be completed within a total of 60 seconds. \\n\\nIn the pre-validation phase, which lasts for 15 seconds, two unit tests are conducted sequentially to ensure the system is in a steady state before fault injection. The first test, named 'pre-unittest-example-pod-running', checks the 'example-pod' running status. It starts immediately at the beginning of the phase and runs for 5 seconds. Following this, the second test, 'pre-unittest-example-service-availability', begins at the 5-second mark and also runs for 5 seconds, verifying the service's availability.\\n\\nThe fault-injection phase spans 30 seconds and involves two types of faults: PodChaos and NetworkChaos. Initially, the PodChaos fault, named 'fault-podchaos', is injected at the start of the phase and lasts for 10 seconds. Concurrently, the 'fault-unittest-example-pod-running' unit test runs for the same duration to verify the pod's status during the fault. After the PodChaos fault concludes, the NetworkChaos fault, named 'fault-networkchaos', begins at the 10-second mark and continues for 20 seconds. Simultaneously, the 'fault-unittest-example-service-availability' test runs for 20 seconds, starting at the same time as the NetworkChaos fault, to check the service's availability under network stress.\\n\\nFinally, the post-validation phase, also 15 seconds long, ensures the system returns to its steady states. The 'post-unittest-example-pod-running' test starts after a 2-second grace period and runs for 6 seconds to verify the pod's status. Subsequently, the 'post-unittest-example-service-availability' test begins at the 8-second mark and runs for 5 seconds, checking the service's availability. This sequential execution allows for a brief stabilization period before each test.\"}"
